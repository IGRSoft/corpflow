"""Comparability gate + join for two single-arm records (AC-8 to AC-11).

Pure: two parsed record dicts in, a list of refusals or a joined ``BenchmarkRecord``
out. No filesystem, no clock, no subprocess, and no ``benchmarklive`` import — the
join is analysis, not dispatch, and sits on the same side of the boundary as the
analyzer and the reporter.

The gate is fail-closed. A permissive gate is worse than no gate: it launders two
incomparable runs as a comparison, which is the exact misreading this work exists to
prevent. Every axis except the time gap refuses, and every axis is evaluated so a
reader sees all of them at once rather than fixing one and hitting the next.
