"""Budget enforcement for live dispatch.

Two gates: (a) PRE-FLIGHT projection > budget → decline before any dispatch (rc=2);
(b) RUNNING-TALLY abort before each stage → partial record written before rc=4 (D6).
Neither fabricates spend — the tally only accumulates REAL per-stage costs (None adds
nothing). SR stays in PIPELINE_STAGES (AR delta D3).

`--budget` bounds what dispatch will START, not what a run realizes: gate (b) can
refuse the next stage but a dispatch already in flight has no cost ceiling, so
realized spend can exceed the cap by one stage. `RunningTally` holds back a reserve
sized from observed spend to keep that excess to the first stage that surprises the
projection; nothing here makes the cap absolute.
