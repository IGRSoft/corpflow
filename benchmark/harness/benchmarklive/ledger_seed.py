"""Seed the WITH arm's ledger the way the production orchestrator leaves it.

In a real worktask the orchestrator seeds the ledger, PL0 seeds every downstream stage
row (``state-patch.sh --task-create``) and the plan gate stamps the approval carrier
before any stage is dispatched. The harness dispatches bare ``claude -p`` stages, so
none of that happened: DV found no ``DV0`` row (``--claim`` -> "unknown task id"), never
saw an approved plan, and both DV and QA had their test runs denied by
``hooks/test-execution-gate.sh``, which resolves the acting stage from the single
``in_progress`` row. Rows are written through the real ``state-patch.sh`` so the ledger
contract stays the script's, never re-implemented here.

Only stages whose captures showed the failure are seeded (``SEEDED_STAGES``); every other
stage's completion patch creates its own row.
