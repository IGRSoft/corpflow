# User-decision ledger

Specification for `.context/decisions.jsonl`, the record of the user's answers to `AskUserQuestion`
inside a worktask. One hook writes it, one read-only op verifies it, and a stage accepts a decision
only through that op (`skills/shared/stage-contracts.md § A user decision is accepted only from the
ledger`). The ledger gives tamper evidence, not tamper proof, and uses no signed token. What it
cannot stop is listed under § Security notes.

| Part | Where |
|---|---|
| Record, and the write guard | `hooks/user-decision-record.sh` |
| Every ledger rule: hash, chain, scope, lock, verify | `hooks/lib/user-decision-lib.sh` |
| The verifier | `skills/worktask/scripts/state-patch.sh --verify-decision` |
| Resume by reference | `skills/worktask/scripts/blocked-on-dispatch.sh resume` |

## Why the ledger exists

In one observed run a stage rightly refused consent that the orchestrator relayed as prose, and the
run stalled: nothing the stage could check stood behind the relay. The ledger is that record. The
orchestrator passes only a row id, and the verifier is the only path by which answer text reaches a
stage.

## Row shape

One row per answered, scoped question, serialised with `jq -c` as one LF-terminated line, with its
keys in exactly this order:

```json
{"id":"ud-20260917T101500Z-3","ts":"<UTC timestamp>","actor":"hook:user-decision","tool_use_id":"<tool_use id>","question":"<verbatim>","answer":"<verbatim>","scope":{"worktask_id":"<worktask id>","task_ids":["DV0"],"item":"sw-DV0-1"},"sha256":"<64 hex>","prev_sha256":"<64 hex, or null on row 1>"}
```

- The file is created with mode 0600 in `.context/`, beside `state.json`.
- The hook refuses to append after a last line with no LF (`ledger_torn`).
- The shape is the `.context/decisions.jsonl user-decision row` seam of the milestone's Shared Seams
  registry; a change to a field, the hash inputs or the chain rule updates that entry too.

## Canonical hash

`sha256` is the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the bytes `jq -jc '[.question,.answer]'` prints for the
row: a JSON array with no trailing LF. The array keeps question and answer apart, which plain
concatenation would not.

### The byte rule

Decoded question or answer text never passes through a shell variable, `$(…)` or `read`. It moves
only as jq reading a file or a pipe, or as the argv of `--expect-answer`. A JSON-encoded line may sit
in a variable. A shell round trip can strip a trailing newline and change the digest.

### Digest tools and jq drift

- The digest tool is `shasum -a 256`, else `sha256sum`, which is also used when `shasum` fails or
  prints nothing. There is no cksum fallback: with neither tool the hook refuses with
  `no_digest_tool` and the verifier exits 2.
- Every digest must match `^[0-9a-f]{64}$`. jq 1.6 or later is required.
- jq 1.6 and 1.7+ escape U+007F differently, so the hook refuses a question or answer holding it
  (`unstable_encoding`).
- The verifier runs a pinned probe (DEL, U+2028, U+FFFD, control characters, a non-BMP character,
  `/`, `\`) in its batched pass. A mismatch exits 2 with `jq_canon_drift`, never 5, so drift is never
  read as forgery.

## Id and chain

- `id` is `ud-<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>-<n>`, where `n` is the row's 1-based line number (`UD_ID_RE`).
- `prev_sha256` is the SHA-256 of the previous line's bytes without its LF, and `null` on row 1.
- The verifier hashes stored lines and never re-serialises them. An `n` other than the row's line
  number is `chain_broken`, and a key set or key order other than the one above is `malformed_row`.

An edit, insert, reorder or deletion before the last row breaks the chain for every later row. The
last row is covered by its own `sha256` and by its audit row (§ Security notes, S3).

## Scope ladder

The hook reads scope from `state.json` only, never from free text. `worktask_id` is always
`state.json .worktask_id`, and each question takes the first rung it meets.

1. **A parked need.** `header` is a task `H` that is `blocked` on `user_decision`, and its
   `detail.question` is byte-equal to the asked question. `task_ids` is every task blocked on an
   equal `(question, options, item)`, sorted. `item` is `detail.item`, or `null`.
2. **A sweep item.** `header` matches `^sw-[A-Z]{2}[0-9]+-[0-9]+$` and is an id in
   `facts.open_questions[]`. `task_ids` is the one task the id names, and `item` is the id.
   `commands/worktask.md § Step C.4` sets that header.
3. **Anything else** writes no row (`no_scope`). A permission or gate prompt can quote commands and
   secrets, and a row that covers no task could never authorise anything.

### Scope ladder — rung 3 is an open question

Open question sw-AR0-1 asks whether rung 3 should record with empty `task_ids`. It does not block
this design, and until it is answered rung 3 writes nothing. Gate and permission answers keep their
audit rows either way.

## Provenance

The hook runs on PostToolUse `AskUserQuestion`. Its checks run in order and the first failure wins.
On a failure it writes no row and one `user_decision_refused` audit row, then exits 0 with no
stdout. A fork subagent's call (`agent_id` present) is accepted: the answer is still the user's.

### Provenance — P1 to P3

- **P1 context.** `corpflow_context_root` finds a `state.json` with a non-empty `.worktask_id`.
  Otherwise the hook exits silently, because there is no context to audit into.
- **P2 event.** `hook_event_name` is `PostToolUse`, `tool_name` is `AskUserQuestion`, and
  `tool_use_id` matches `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,128}$` (`bad_event`).
- **P3 the user answered.** `tool_input.answers` alone is no signal, since the permission UI fills it
  for genuine answers. A pre-answer shows as `answers` in the transcript's own `tool_use.input`
  (`pre_answered`). A `tool_response.afkTimeoutMs` is an idle auto-answer (`idle_auto_answer`), and
  a response with no per-question answers is `no_answer`.

### Provenance — P4 to P7

- **P4 transcript.** `transcript_path` is a regular file, not a symlink, named `<session_id>.jsonl`.
  It holds an assistant `tool_use` with this id, name `AskUserQuestion` and the same
  `input.questions[].question` values. It is re-read up to 3 times, 0.2 s apart, for a flush race
  (`transcript_miss`).
- **P5 dedupe.** The `tool_use_id` is not already in the ledger (`replay`).
- **P6 answer.** `tool_response.answers[<question>]`, else `tool_input.answers[<question>]`. A
  string is kept verbatim, an array of strings is joined with `", "`, and anything else is
  `answer_shape`.
- **P7 scope.** § Scope ladder. When no question in the call scopes, the call writes nothing.

The PostToolUse `tool_response` shape for this tool is inferred to match the SDK's
`AskUserQuestionOutput`, and the test fixtures pin the shape used.

### Provenance — the append refusals

After P7 the append itself can refuse: `unstable_encoding`, `ledger_torn`, `lock_timeout`,
`no_digest_tool` or `ledger_symlink`. Each writes no row and one `user_decision_refused` audit row.

## Lock and append

- **Lock.** `mkdir decisions.jsonl.lock`. A symlinked ledger or lock is refused (`ledger_symlink`).
- **Timeout.** Up to 25 tries, 0.2 s apart, then fail closed with `lock_timeout`. An unlocked
  append could fork the chain and poison every later row; a lost row only means the question is
  asked again.
- **Stale lock.** An mtime of 60 s or more, or a dead owner pid on the same host. The owner writes a
  token into the lock dir. A breaker removes `owner` only while it still reads the token it aged,
  then runs a plain `rmdir`, never `rm -rf`, so a successor's lock survives.
- **Hook timeout.** The manifest gives both entries `timeout: 15` s, and the retry budget stays at
  13 s or less.

### Lock and append — what the lock covers

The lock covers the tail check, dedupe, and the id and `prev_sha256` computation. The append copies
the ledger into an `mktemp` file in the same directory under umask 077, appends the rows and renames
with `mv -f`, so the lock-free verifier never reads a half row. There is no second tail check after
the copy: the tail check that matters runs under the lock before any row is built. A symlinked
ledger is refused as `ledger_symlink` before the lock is taken, not replaced, and the rename is
skipped if the ledger has become a symlink by then. Each row's `user_decision_recorded` audit row is written under the same lock, after the
rename, and confirmed with `grep -F`; a miss reports `degraded`.

## Write guard

The same script runs on PreToolUse `Write|Edit|Bash` as a separate manifest entry. It only ever
emits a deny, so it cannot loosen a deny or ask from another hook, and it has no ordering dependency.

- **Fast path.** Stdin naming neither `decisions.jsonl` nor `user-decision-record.sh` exits 0 at
  once, as does a tree with no `state.json`.
- **Write or Edit.** Denied when `file_path`, resolved to its physical parent plus basename, is the
  ledger or lies under its lock dir. Editing the hook source stays allowed.
- **Fail closed.** After a fast-path hit, a missing jq or library denies. There is no environment
  switch.

### Write guard — Bash

- **Naming the ledger.** Allowed only when every segment, split on `|`, `;`, `&&`, `||`, `&` and
  newline with assignments stripped, starts with one of `cat head tail wc grep jq ls stat file
  shasum sha256sum`. The command must hold no `$(`, backtick, `<(`, `>(`, `eval`, `xargs` or `tee`,
  and no `>` other than `2>/dev/null`, `>/dev/null`, `2>&1` or `>&2`.
- **Running the hook.** Denied when a segment executes `user-decision-record.sh`, as the program or
  as the operand of `bash`, `sh`, `zsh`, `source`, `.` or `exec`. `bash -n` and `shellcheck` stay
  allowed.
- **The cost.** False denials, such as `jq '.a > 1'` on the ledger. The deny reason names the read
  path.

## Verifier

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/worktask/scripts/state-patch.sh --verify-decision <ud-id> --task-id <ID> [--expect-answer <text>]
```

Read-only: no lock, no log, no audit row, no state write. It runs right after the root ladder,
before pre-flight. It reads the ledger and the audit log beside the resolved `state.json`, as
`.context/decisions.jsonl` and `.context/logs/audit.jsonl`. Every call walks the whole chain over
one snapshot, in about five forks at any size.

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | valid |
| 5 | refused |
| 2 | usage or IO: id grammar, missing `--task-id`, unresolved state, unreadable library, no jq or digest tool, `jq_canon_drift` |
| 1 | internal error |

Stdout is one JSON object: `{decision_ref, task_id, valid, reasons[], question, answer, scope,
row_index, chain_rows}`. `question`, `answer` and `scope` are printed only when `valid` is true and
are `null` otherwise, so a forged row's text never reaches an agent.

### Verifier — whole-ledger reasons

A closed set, in check order. These eight judge every row, so an edit anywhere refuses every
decision in the file.

| Reason | Means |
|---|---|
| `not_found` | no row has the id |
| `ledger_symlink` | the ledger is a symlink |
| `malformed_row` | a line is not one row with the keys above in order, holds NUL or CR, or the file lacks its final LF |
| `duplicate_id` | two rows share an id |
| `duplicate_tool_use` | two rows share a `tool_use_id` |
| `actor_mismatch` | a row's `actor` is not `hook:user-decision` |
| `sha256_mismatch` | a row's `sha256` is not its canonical digest |
| `chain_broken` | a `prev_sha256` or an id ordinal does not match |

### Verifier — target-row reasons

These four follow, and judge the row the id names.

| Reason | Means |
|---|---|
| `worktask_mismatch` | `scope.worktask_id` is not this worktask |
| `scope_not_covering` | `scope.task_ids` lacks the `--task-id` value |
| `audit_uncorroborated` | no `user_decision_recorded` row from `hook:user-decision` matches the id, `tool_use_id` and line digest, or one with the same id has a different digest |
| `answer_mismatch` | `--expect-answer` differs from the stored answer |

## Audit rows

Actor `hook:user-decision`, with `task_id` from `corpflow_audit_task_id`. No row carries question or
answer text.

| action | result | subject | metadata |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user_decision_recorded` | ok | the `ud-` id | `{decision_id, tool_use_id, row_sha256, item}` |
| `user_decision_refused` | skipped | `AskUserQuestion` | `{reason}`, plus `tool_use_id` once P2 passed |
| `user_decision_ledger_write_denied` | block | the tool | `{tool, dedupe_key, command_head, truncated}`, head of at most 4 tokens |

`user_decision_recorded` is the `answered` leg of the `user_decision` blocked-on arm.

## Relay by reference

1. `route` parks a stage's `user_decision` need and writes the `asked` leg.
2. `batch` asks the stage's question verbatim, with `header` set to the lowest covered task id.
3. The user answers. The hook writes the row and its `user_decision_recorded` audit row.
4. `blocked-on-dispatch.sh resume --task-id <ID> --leg resumed [--decision-ref <ud-id>]` finds a
   verified row covering the task, writes `resumed` with that `decision_ref`, and returns an
   `instruction` that names the verify command and no answer text.
5. The orchestrator delivers that instruction unmodified and never appends the answer it saw
   (`skills/worktask/SKILL.md § Step 7a — a user decision resumes by reference`).
6. The stage verifies the ref and cites it in `decisions_applied: [ud-…]`.

Declining the dialog writes no row, so `resume` exits 1, nothing is written, and the run stops with
the task still parked.

## Megatask

A `/megatask` per-issue run has no user, so it parks a `user_decision` need as it always did, and
`escalated[]` gets `{kind: "user_decision"}`. Only an attended `/worktask --resume` in that issue's
worktree resolves it. A prompt answered in the parent session resolves that session's own context
root and covers nothing, so it fails closed.

## Security notes

The ledger is tamper-evident, not tamper-proof. These risks remain, each with what narrows it.

### S1 — a forged tail append

Until upstream U1 lands, a subagent or the orchestrator with Bash could still append a forged row
with a correct `prev_sha256`, plus a matching `user_decision_recorded` audit row. The chain detects a
forged row only when that row breaks the chain, and a well-formed tail append does not. The write
guard is a speed bump that obfuscated shell evades. Audit corroboration, which fails closed, means a
forgery needs both writes to land, and dedupe on the `(tool_use_id, question)` pair blocks a replay.
Re-invoking this hook is not the cheap path to both writes it once was: a segment naming
`user-decision-record.sh` is denied unless it is `bash -n`, shellcheck or a read-only reader, so
feeding the hook a hand-built payload no longer mints the row and its audit row for free. What is
left is a shell that writes both files without naming either — obfuscation the guard cannot see. U1, the
harness forwarding a user's answer into a subagent thread itself, is tracked outside this milestone.

### S2 — a forged transcript

P4 trusts the transcript file, which Bash can also write. Binding its basename to the payload's
`session_id` raises the bar without closing the gap.

### S3 — a last-row edit or truncation

No later row covers the last one. An edit to it is caught by its own `sha256` and by the audit row's
`row_sha256`. Truncation removes decisions, and each removed id fails closed as `not_found`.

### S4 — answers the user did not give

A PreToolUse `updatedInput` from another plugin or a settings hook is indistinguishable from a real
answer, except when the transcript's `tool_use.input` already carries `answers` (P3). Keep Claude
Code's `askUserQuestionTimeout` off; an answer carrying `afkTimeoutMs` is refused as
`idle_auto_answer`.

### S5 — retention

The ledger holds verbatim question and answer text, as the registry seam requires. It is mode 0600,
lives under `.context/`, which the committed `.gitignore` excludes, and receives rung 1 and rung 2
questions only. Audit rows
never hold the text.

### S6 — root divergence

If the hook and the verifier resolve different `.context` roots, the verifier finds no row and
refuses with `not_found`, which fails closed. Both use the shared root ladder.

### S7 — jq drift

A jq upgrade that changes escaping beyond U+007F makes old rows refuse. The probe reports it as
`jq_canon_drift` with exit 2, so it fails closed and is never read as forgery.
