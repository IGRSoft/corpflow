# model-switch-gate — PreModelSwitch gate refusing a mid-worktask re-tier away from
# the model a stage was dispatched with. No matcher in plugin.json; self-filters.
#
# PAYLOAD SCHEMA IS UNCONFIRMED. CC 2.1.251 postdates every doc in this repo and no
# live payload has been observed. Split, per the schema-drift discipline in
# skills/agent-coordination/references/headless-dispatch.md § Schema Versioning Watch:
#
#   CONFIRMED (every other hook payload in this plugin carries them):
#     session_id, agent_id
#   ASSUMED — read through a first-match coalesce, all equally speculative:
#     destination  to_model / toModel / requested_model / requestedModel / new_model / newModel
#     origin       from_model / fromModel / current_model / currentModel
#     trigger      reason / trigger / source
#
# The PIN is not assumed: it comes from this plugin's own
# .facts.dispatched_agents[].model_requested.
#
# Behavior:
#   - Exits 0 ALWAYS. A block travels in the stdout JSON, never in the exit code —
#     hook-monitoring.md § PreToolUse decisions records that an exit-2 block holds
#     even when its JSON fails schema validation, so a wrong field guess paired with
#     a non-zero exit would wedge every session that switches models.
#   - Fails OPEN structurally, not by discipline: BLOCK is reachable only once the
#     destination coalesce matches a real field. If every guess is wrong the
#     destination is empty and the ladder can only reach silent-pass or annotate.
#   - The two axes fail open differently. The DESTINATION axis enforces once it
#     matches a real field. The TRIGGER axis only enforces once a trigger field is
#     observed: absent means no evidence (row 6a, annotate), present-but-unknown
#     means the field name is confirmed and only its vocabulary is not (row 6b,
#     the one reachable deny).
#   - Silent for any session with no worktask ledger, no single in_progress stage,
#     or no unambiguous pin — zero side effects, no directory creation.
#   - CORPFLOW_MODEL_SWITCH_GATE=off disables rows 4-6. Process env only; an agent
#     cannot self-serve it from a command string.
#   - jq absent -> exit 0.

# into an exit-2 hard block on every model switch in every session. Capture `$-`,
# drop `-e` across the source, restore it only if it was set. The `command -v`
