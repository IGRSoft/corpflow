# SubagentStop → audit.jsonl writer (corpflow worktask plugin).
# Replaces prose-instructed `subagent_stopped` row emission. Pairs with
# state-merge.sh; both fire on SubagentStop, both target .context/.
#
# Dedupe: metadata.dedupe_key = "<session_id>:<agent_id>:stop".
#
# The runtime sends `agent_type: ""` (not null) for plugin agents, so `//` alone
# leaves the row anonymous. Reader-keyed fields go through `first_nonempty`,
# which rejects "" as well as null.
#
# Phantom rows: the runtime fires this event on a ~31s cadence for the whole life
# of a dispatch, so one real agent produced 21 rows. Those are suppressed (see
# SUPPRESS below) and COUNTED, because a suppression that leaves no trace narrows
# the audit trail invisibly, which is the failure class this hook exists to
# record rather than create.
#
# The discriminator is a repeated dedupe_key, never the row's fields: every stop
# the runtime delivers, phantom or terminal, arrives with no stage and duration 0,
# so those fields cannot tell them apart. A phantom is a key the trail already
# holds — the duplicate the dedupe_key is declared for.
