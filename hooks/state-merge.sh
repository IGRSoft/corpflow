#!/usr/bin/env bash
# state-merge.sh — SubagentStop hook (OPTIONAL belt-and-suspenders for
# the handoff protocol). Reads the artifact's `handoff:` frontmatter and
# atomic-merges it into .context/state.json.
#
# Contract:
#   - Exits 0 ALWAYS — must never block a stage transition. Failures log to
#     .context/logs/state-merge.log and stderr.
#   - Idempotent: a ledger already reflecting this frontmatter is left alone.
#   - Absent state.json: log INFO and exit 0 (F1, context_files mode).
#   - Corrupt state.json: the original is copied aside and verified before any
#     write; an unverifiable backup aborts the repair and leaves the file as
#     found. The original is never destroyed.
#   - Absent frontmatter: derive a minimal handoff from CLAUDE_AGENT_NAME and
#     CLAUDE_ARTIFACT_PATH.
#   - YAML: prefer yq, else an inline awk subset (we own the schema).
#
# Env from Claude Code: CLAUDE_TASK_ID, CLAUDE_AGENT_NAME,
# CLAUDE_ARTIFACT_PATH, CLAUDE_WORKTASK_ID, CLAUDE_DURATION_MS,
# CLAUDE_TASK_METADATA_STAGE.
#
# All merge logic lives in skills/worktask/scripts/state-patch.sh; this is a
# delegating wrapper. That script is resolved from $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT first (a
# project-local copy has no skills/ tree beside it), else one level up.
#
# Usage (manual self-test):
#   state-merge.sh --self-test
#
# Usage (manual invocation):
#   CLAUDE_ARTIFACT_PATH=.context/development.md \
#   CLAUDE_TASK_METADATA_STAGE=DV \
#   .claude/hooks/state-merge.sh

# stream, whose cwd is a linked worktree where `.context/` does not exist (it is
# gitignored and never carried into a worktree checkout). A cwd-relative merge
# lands in a throwaway ledger, silently. `write` mode, not `read`: this hook
# writes, so the declared workspace must win even before `.context/` exists.
#
# Guarded source (AD-2): a truncated library is a syntax error, fatal under this
# script's `set -e` and unrescuable by `||`, which would break a hook whose whole
# contract is "exit 0 ALWAYS". Capture `$-`, drop `-e` across the source, restore.
