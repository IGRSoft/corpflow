# Stage comes from .context/state.json alone, never agent identity or env, so a
# nested delegate inherits the in-progress stage. The Task branch only observes:
# a dispatch prompt quoting the ban names every runner, so matching prose there
# would refuse to dispatch the stages that implement the policy.

# Exits 0 always; the decision travels in hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision,

# reached from a command string: CORPFLOW_TEST_GATE=off, CORPFLOW_TEST_DEDUPE=off.
#
# No `set -e`: a false compound test is control flow here, and aborting mid-
# classification would turn a fail-open backstop closed. `set -f` is load-bearing
# — the xcodebuild and gradle scans word-split an unquoted fragment on purpose.

# MULTI_PURPOSE_RUNNERS is the subset with non-test shapes (`swift build`,
# `go build`), where the subcommand must name "test" — for gradle, a task
# containing "test" — before anything classifies as test execution.

# Known bypasses, all allow-direction: $(...)/backticks/here-docs are not
# segment-split; `find -exec`, `xargs`, and a renamed or written-then-executed
# runner never reach head position; `env -i`, `\pytest`, and `bash -c'x'` (no
# space) are not unwrapped; nesting past MAX_RECURSE_DEPTH classifies not_test
# rather than recursing unboundedly; `npm test --dry-run` classifies build_only
# while npm still runs the script. This hook is a backstop — tool-grant
# narrowing and the orchestrator's ban banner are the controls without gaps.

# A quoted value containing a space (`FOO="a b" pytest x`) is not one
# space-delimited word, so a naive strip-to-next-space leaves a fragment in head
# position — which either drops the invocation out of RUNNERS (the gate never
# fires) or collides with a real runner name and denies something that was never
# a test. The pattern consumes a quoted or bare value as one unit; `[[ =~ ]]`
# keeps it fork-free.
