# dv-comment-density-gate — SubagentStop gate blocking a code-writing agent when
# a changed source file is more comment than skills/code-comment-standard allows.
# No matcher in plugin.json; the hook self-filters.
#
# The agent filter matches any writer (*developer*, *code-fixer*,
# *test-generator*) rather than one exact id, since a worktree waiver can
# dispatch a platform agent directly. Silent for reviewers, so a reviewer is
# never blocked for the writer's bloat.
#
# Behavior:
#   - No-op (exit 0) for non-writers, or when no source file changed.
#   - Density is the comment share of a file's ADDED lines (whole body for a new
#     file), so an agent is never blocked for inheriting existing bloat. Files
#     under MIN_ADDED_LINES are skipped — bulk-authored files are the target.
#   - Two signals, either one blocks: the ESSAY share (comment lines sitting in
#     runs longer than the per-declaration budget) over CORPFLOW_COMMENT_DENSITY_MAX
#     (default 40), or the aggregate share over the looser ..._HARD ceiling.
#     A block carries remediation in additionalContext plus a
#     comment_density_block row. Under -> pass, warning in the row past
#     ..._WARN (default 30) without blocking.
#   - jq or git absent -> exit 0, like the sibling gates.
#   - Exit is ALWAYS 0; a block travels in the decision JSON, never the code.
#   - --self-test: bloated fixture blocks, lean fixture passes.
set -eu

# Measured against a real offending branch: added-line density ran 26-67% per
# file, and 40 catches every genuine offender while clearing the two files whose
# documentation was proportionate. That ceiling scores the ESSAY share, not the
# aggregate: a 20-case enum with one budget-compliant /// per one-line case is
# structurally ~1:1 and measured 48% aggregate, so the aggregate alone cannot
# separate an essay from a long list of compliant one-liners.
