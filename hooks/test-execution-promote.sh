# test-execution-promote — PostToolUse companion of hooks/test-execution-gate.sh.
#
# Registered on PostToolUseFailure as well: a non-zero runner exit is delivered
# as an error tool result, which fires that event INSTEAD of PostToolUse, so a
# PostToolUse-only registration would leave every failing run unrecorded.
#
# The gate is a PreToolUse hook, so it fires before any result exists: recording
# a run's fingerprint there let an invocation that aborted having executed
# nothing claim that fingerprint permanently, and every later attempt against the
# same tree was denied on the strength of a run that produced no evidence. The
# gate now writes only a `.pending` marker; this hook promotes it to a real
# sentinel once the tool actually produced a result, and deletes it otherwise.
#
# It computes NOTHING of its own: the gate is sourced with --lib-only so the
# classifier, the invocation derivation and the key are the same definitions the
# gate itself used. Two independent derivations would orphan every marker and
# disable suppression silently — the failure this design exists to prevent.
#
# Exits 0 always and emits no decision. A PostToolUse hook cannot un-run the
# tool, and a promotion failure only means the next identical run is allowed.

# tool_evidence_token <payload> -> prints ONE evidence token and returns 0, or
# prints nothing and returns non-zero.
#
# Deriving the token and deciding to promote are ONE computation on purpose. Two
# separate computations can disagree, and the shape of that disagreement is the
# defect this replaces: a marker promoted for an invocation that produced
# nothing, whose denial then cited a run with no result to name. If the evidence
# cannot be named, the run does not get to deny its own retry.
#
# The narrowest observable that separates a real run from an abort is
# `tool_response`: present and non-empty, with no error flag. A FAILING call
# carries no `tool_response` at all — the failure arrives as a top-level `error`
# string — so keying on it there would discard every red suite and suppress only
# green ones, inverting the point: a red suite that printed its failures IS a
# run. On that event the error text therefore counts as output. `is_interrupt`
# is the one failure kept inert: a cancelled call produced no evidence at all.
#
# Ladder, most specific first — the whole reason a token is carried rather than
# a boolean is that a reader of a later denial can tell at a glance how strong
# the cited run's evidence was:
#
#   bundle:<name>   the BASENAME of a results artifact that exists on this host
#   tests:<n>       a count read off the runner's summary line, alongside outcome
#                   vocabulary proving the cases actually ran
#   discovered:<n>  a count with NO outcome vocabulary anywhere — an enumeration,
#                   not an execution. Deliberately a distinct token shape: the
#                   suppression gate must be able to tell it from a result, and a
#                   `tests:` that meant either was indistinguishable to every
#                   reader downstream
#   output:<n>B     a response was present but said nothing interpretable
#   errtext:<n>B    the PostToolUseFailure arm — a red suite that printed
#
# Rung three keeps the honest limit ("a runner that exits 0 having executed 0
# tests still promotes") while making it VISIBLE: `output:812B` in a denial says
# the cited run recorded no count, which is the hour of diagnosis this exists to
# remove.
#
# SECURITY — the token is interpolated into a policy denial that a model reads,
# so it is a channel from tool output into a policy string. Structure was never
# the weak half: the outer filter is one whitespace-free run of
# [A-Za-z0-9._/:+-], bounded at 120 characters (which also keeps the sentinel
# line inside dedupe_lookup's `head -c 200`), it runs before the bound so
# droppable bytes cannot smuggle length past it, and emit_deny escapes through
# `jq --arg`. The weak half was the ALPHABET: that charset is a complete one for
# dot- and slash-separated English, and this rung used to pass a caller-supplied
# path through unchanged, so a response could land a hundred characters of
# chosen prose verbatim in a refusal. Three of the four rungs never could — they
# emit derived numerics and nothing else. This one now emits an existing file's
# basename, so the free text is gone and what remains must first be made real on
# disk. Empty after all of it means no evidence, which means discard: predicate
# and token stay one thing.
