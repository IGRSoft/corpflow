# Request Plan Command

Produce a lightweight, grounded plan from a free-form request plus current repository context, then
hand off to the worktask system — lighter than a PRD (`/product-requirements`), broader than a
sizing estimate (`/estimate`).

Thin entry point to the `request-plan` skill, which holds the full workflow and templates.

## Options

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `--save` | Also write the plan to `.context/request-plan-0.md` (naming per `skills/task-folder-organization/SKILL.md`). Default: inline output only. |

```
/request-plan "we keep getting duplicate push notifications, help me plan a fix"
/request-plan --save "add CSV export to the estimates feature"
/request-plan "split the 4k-line sync manager into testable units"
/request-plan --save "migrate the app from UIKit to SwiftUI"
```

- Line 1 — a bug with no known cause: context gathering reads the failing area before scoping.
- Line 3 — a refactor: no new behaviour, so Scope carries the seams and Risks the regression surface.
- Line 4 — XL work: the plan splits it into sub-tasks and triggers the first.

## Workflow

1. Load the `request-plan` skill (`skills/request-plan/SKILL.md`) and follow its five steps.
2. Keep it lightweight. A heavier sibling command may be named alongside the handoff, never in
   place of it — `SKILL.md § 4` holds the list and is the authority.
3. End with a single ready-to-paste `/worktask` command line (PL0 dynamic sizing drops stages for
   small tasks), with the one exception `SKILL.md § 4` states. XL work still gets its line, for
   the first sub-task — `skills/request-plan/references/handoff.md § Escalation beats size`.

## Output Format

`skills/request-plan/references/plan-template.md` — `# Plan: <one-line goal>` then
Context · Goal · Scope · Phases · Effort (rough) · Risks & Dependencies ·
Recommended next step (the single `/worktask` command line).
