"""gen-request-plan-cases — emit the request-plan eval set from a dimension table.

Cases are data here rather than hand-written JSON so the 72-cell space stays
auditable and regenerable. Three dimensions, chosen from observed failures:
request type, repo grounding, and routing pressure.

Grounding drives what each case can prove:
  obvious  — the prompt names the surface, so discovery targets a RELATED file
  buried   — the prompt describes the need only; discovery targets the surface
             itself, the strongest test in the set
  adjacent — the near-miss surface exists; the plan must name it
  absent   — nothing to ground on, so the case expects a clarification instead

Two derived assertions per planning case (routing + discovery) hold every case at
25% case-specific. Generation fails closed on an unresolvable path or a discovery
token echoed from its own prompt, so a bad case can never reach a paid capture.

Usage: gen-request-plan-cases.py [--out PATH] [--check]

    # ---- batch 5 (ids 168+): a held-out tranche built to contain failures ----
    # Batch 4's tranche came back degenerate: 18 cases, all `pass`, so held-out TPR read
    # 100% on an all-positive set and held-out TNR was unmeasurable — and TNR is the rate
    # that missed its 80% floor (69% at 0.2.0). Sampling the model's strongest cells
    # produced no failures for the grader to be scored against.
    #
    # These sample where the 0.2.0 dimension tables say the model actually fails, so the
    # tranche contains failures by natural occurrence. A failure cannot be constructed,
    # only made likely: 18 `absent` (harness 71%, human 2/6 — the weakest column measured,
    # and it doubles that column from 17 to 35), 9 `refute`, 10 `adjacent` (16 in corpus,
    # none held out), 8 `buried` weighted to incident/migration/feature, and route weighted
    # to `emerg` (79%) over `std` (81%).
    #
    # Weighting to `absent` also dissolves batch 4's surface problem: an `absent` case
    # grounds on nothing by definition, so 18 of the 45 spend no scarce surface. The 18
    # plan cases that need one draw from what the registry still excludes and no case had
    # claimed — skills/*/references/, skills/shared/*.md, and the tests/ tree, which
    # capability-registry.sh excludes for the same reason and batch 4 never touched. The
    # 9 refute cases ground on registry-LISTED scripts on purpose: the model is meant to
    # find the shipped capability and dispute the premise, so a lookup is the right
    # affordance there and it spends none of the search pool.
    #
    # Held out by construction, the same way batch 4 succeeded batch 3's 97-121: written
    # after the frozen manifest, pinned before any capture reads them. Batch 4's 18 are
    # REPLACED, not grown — they were read during 0.2.0 labelling, and per RESTRATIFY_NOTE
    # re-stratifying does not make a case unread. Do not pass --restratify.

    # absent: nothing in this repo to ground on, so the case expects a clarification.
