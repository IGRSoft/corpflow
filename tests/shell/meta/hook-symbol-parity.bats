# Target: the shared hook library's symbol surface versus what hooks/ calls.
#
# A renamed or deleted library symbol is the failure most likely to actually
# happen, and it is silent at runtime: every consumer degrades to a fail-open
# allow rather than erroring, which is correct behaviour and therefore invisible.
# This is the check that makes the rename loud, at CI, in one place.

# skills/shared/lib/ and consumer suites source it twice per process — so it supplies
