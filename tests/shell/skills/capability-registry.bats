# Contract tests for skills/request-plan/scripts/capability-registry.sh
# Contracts (from source):
#   Enumerates commands/*.md, agents/*.md, skills/*/SKILL.md, hooks/*.sh,
#     skills/*/scripts/*.{sh,py} and benchmark/harness/**/*.py (tests excluded),
#     one line each.
#   Line shape: "<path> — <description>", em-dash separated.
#   Description source per class: markdown = frontmatter `description:` ONLY;
#     shell = `@description` when present, else the first comment block after the
#     shebang; python = the module docstring's summary paragraph.
#   A multi-line folded description collapses to one line.
#   An asset with no description is omitted rather than emitted half-formed.
#   tests/, evals/, skills/*/references/ and skills/shared/ are never enumerated —
#     the eval corpus grounds its remaining search cases there.
#   stdout closes with a fixed trailer naming those excluded CLASSES and no file,
#     so the list is not read as a complete inventory of the repo.
#   Runs from any cwd: it resolves the plugin root from BASH_SOURCE.
