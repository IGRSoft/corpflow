# Cross-surface contracts for the request-plan rule set.
#
# The request-plan rules live across five files, and three of the four graded
# contradictions in the 0.0.1 capture were two of those files answering the same
# question differently. Most of that cross-read needs a human. These are the parts
# that reduce to a predicate, so the contradiction cannot silently come back.
#
# Contracts:
#   No rule surface names a slash command that does not resolve to commands/*.md
#     (or a Claude Code built-in).
#   commands/request-plan.md makes no "no exception" claim and cites SKILL.md § 4
#     as the authority for the trigger rule.
#   references/plan-template.md carries the required Surface-check line inside its
#     Recommended-next-step block.
#   Only SKILL.md states a search-termination condition; context-gathering.md points
#     at it, and the refuted 0.2.0 phrasing appears nowhere under skills/request-plan/.
#   The --secure asset enumeration exists exactly ONCE under skills/request-plan/
#     (handoff.md's --secure row) and is a SUBSET of the canonical list in
#     skills/estimation-methodology/SKILL.md § Worktask Tier Selection. Both sides
#     are EXTRACTED, never restated here: a hardcoded copy in the test is the same
#     defect the test exists to catch. A deny-list of the topic-flavour terms canon
#     rejects by name backs it up, for prose that states a tier rule without
#     enumerating one.
#
# Every candidate set gets a non-vacuity guard: these files genuinely contain slash
# commands and headings, so an empty match means the collector regressed rather than
# that the repo is clean.
