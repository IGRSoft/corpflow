#!/usr/bin/env bats
# Contract test for skill references in agents/ and commands/ — the sibling of
# cross-plugin-refs.bats, for references that stay inside this plugin.
#
# Caught in practice, from the first paired live run's stage transcripts:
#   - agents/developer.md ordered `Skill("dv-screenshot-capture")` while its
#     `tools:` omitted Skill. The DV stage made zero Skill calls and hand-wrote
#     its own capture script three times, reimplementing the adapter chain
#     skills/dv-screenshot-capture already ships.
#   - agents/stakeholder.md ordered `Skill("self-improvement")` with the same
#     omission, so the mandatory ST retrospective silently never ran.
#   - agents/technical-lead.md called `Skill("dev-code-review")`, which names a
#     command; skills/dev-code-review/ does not exist and never did. Historical:
#     both that call and the command are gone — the command is now
#     commands/tech-code-review.md and the callers name the file, not a skill.
# Every one of these passed the whole suite. Nothing read a `tools:` line
# against the body that depended on it.
#
# The predicates are expressed over each occurrence rather than as a frozen file
# list, for the reason plugin-root-refs.bats states: a list goes red on any doc
# edit without the protected property regressing. Each is driven here against a
# synthetic tree that plants the violation, so the checker itself is falsifiable.
