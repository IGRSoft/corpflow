# Single-sourcing contract for depth-cap visibility.
# (PATH-KEYED filename: agent-coordination__dispatch-depth.bats — the AC-2 gate
# matches on path-derived stems, so a basename collision could never claim
# false coverage.)
#
# The depth cap silently drops a Tier-2 specialist: no hook fires, and the
# refused dispatcher completes the work itself. Two documented mechanisms make
# that visible, and each is only load-bearing if the other half exists —
# an enum value with no contract is undocumented, a contract with no enum value
# is unwritable. These tests pin both halves together:
#
#   - both actions are registered in the audit action registry AND the Writers table
#   - the self-report contract section exists and names all three required fields
#   - worktask check 11 exists, emits the projection row, and never blocks
#   - the two depth projections cross-link, so neither can be edited alone
