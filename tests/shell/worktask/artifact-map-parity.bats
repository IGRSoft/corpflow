# Parity guard for the stage->artifact-basename mapping, which is duplicated
# across the SEVEN sources of truth listed below, with no single owner.
#
# This exists because the duplication has already drifted once: cada9e4 (v3.8.0)
# normalized four sibling artifact basenames and missed AR's, leaving `analyzing`
# stranded until 3.42.0. A half-applied rename across these six is invisible to
# every other test in the suite -- state-merge.sh's map in particular is only
# reachable when state-patch.sh is absent, so nothing exercises it organically.
#
# state-patch.sh additionally accepts resolution-only ALIAS basenames. They live in
# a sibling function so the extractor below keeps seeing exactly one canonical name
# per stage; the alias tests assert that separation rather than relaxing it.
#
