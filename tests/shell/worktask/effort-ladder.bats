# Both stage-codes.md tables, normalized to `agent<TAB>model<TAB>effort`. They carry
# DIFFERENT column orders (Primary: Stage,Agent,Model,Effort — Support: Agent,Model,Effort,
# InvokedBy), so the header line selects the mapping. A single column-index guess reads the
# Support table's Model column as an agent name and passes vacuously.
#
# Retargeted (architecture-0.md#ad1/#ad6): § Primary Stages and § Support Agents no longer
# carry Model/Effort at all — that pair now lives in one agent-keyed § Agent Model Matrix
# table, read through model-matrix-lib.sh's own validated extractor rather than a second,
# bats-local awk. A fourth parser is a review reject (ad2); this suite is a consumer, not

# ships" moved to what got stamped into the ledger. rework-3 (sw-AR0-1 reversed): --task-create

# real workflow end-to-end rather than a single seam: (1) model-matrix.sh --resolve <agent>,
# the same CLI subprocess PL0 calls (crosses the CLI/parsing boundary, not just a library call);
# (2) paste that resolved pair into --task-create's explicit --metadata, the same paste PL0
# performs, and read back what the ledger actually stored. Doing only (1) would compare the
# resolver against itself (model_resolve's rank-3 fallback IS model_matrix_rows, so a bare
# --resolve call proves nothing new the bijection test below does not already prove); step (2)
# is what still crosses a real seam post-reversal — it is the only place left that can catch a
