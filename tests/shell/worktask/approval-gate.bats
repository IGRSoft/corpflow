# Contract tests for the plan-approval carrier PL0.metadata.approved: the three
# stamp sites in commands/worktask.md, the batch seed in commands/megatask.md,
# the readers in agents/developer.md and agents/product-manager.md, and the
# schema entry in skills/shared/state-ledger.md.
#
# LIMITATION, stated so green is not over-read: the approval check is behaviour
# of an agent, not of a script, so nothing here executes it. What is proven is
# the ledger-and-predicate composition — a real state-patch.sh write of the
# payload written in the doc, cross-checked against the accepted value set and
# the schema enum extracted from their own files at test time. Hardcoding any
# side would let that side drift while the suite stayed green.
#
# Every extraction is guarded (EG1/EG2/EG3 below) because the failure mode this
# file exists to avoid is a test that passes when its own extraction returns
# nothing.
