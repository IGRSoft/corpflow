# tests/COVERAGE.md — per-file coverage report + documented exemptions (AC-3)

**Migration Summary (#221 Swift→Python):** Benchmark harness and skill-script
tests migrated from Swift to Python (stdlib unittest). Skill scripts
(`estimate-calc.py`, `layout-calc.py`) are now tested via in-process importlib
(asserting real contracts) plus CLI smoke, replacing subprocess approximations.
Benchmark harness fully ported to Python (benchmarkkit + benchmarklive, 95 tests),
replacing 140 Swift tests. The TTT artifact package stays Swift (48 tests,
measured via llvm-cov). Python coverage measured via opportunistic coverage.py
(present on host → reported, absent → behavioral gates remain hard requirement).
Bash via kcov or documented assertion-density proxy (macOS case).

**Scaffolded by DV0. QA fills per-file numbers + proxy exemptions after `make coverage` runs.**

## Coverage tooling status

| Tool | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| kcov (bash) | **Installed but UNUSABLE on macOS** (`kcov 43` at `/opt/homebrew/bin/kcov`) | Present, so it *is* the default `make coverage` path — and it runs away there: a bounded probe produced 352 MB of output in 90 s without completing a single target. It mis-parses bash 3.2's `BASH_VERSINFO` guards. Real line coverage requires a GNU/Linux host (bash ≥4); on macOS the assertion-density proxy below is the gate. |
| coverage.py (python) | **opportunistic** | When installed: measures `tests/python` + `benchmark/harness/tests` via `python3 -m unittest`. When absent: behavioral/gate assertions remain hard gate, no clean-clone dependency. |
| swift test --enable-code-coverage (Swift) | **Built into the Swift 6 toolchain** | llvm-cov export JSON per package (`swift test --show-codecov-path`); aggregate line gate via jq. |

`make coverage` (or `make test COVERAGE=1`) runs kcov per `.bats` target + optional
coverage.py for Python suites + `swift test --enable-code-coverage` for
`benchmark/ttt-template` with aggregate line coverage gated at ≥ **85%** per
package (COV_MIN=85). Python coverage is report-only when absent (no gate).

### Swift denominator exclusions (documented, not a blanket exemption)

- `**/Tests/**` and `**/.build/**` — test code and build artifacts.
- `Sources/TicTacToeKit/Views/` — SwiftUI **view bodies**. `body` closures are
  declarative scene descriptions that only execute inside a rendering host;
  headless `swift test` never mounts them, so counting them would make the
  number measure a rendering harness we deliberately don't ship (the benchmark
  fixture must stay offline/CI-safe). The Views' BEHAVIOR is covered where it
  lives: all view state transitions come from `AppRouter`/`GameViewModel`/
  engine/models, which ARE unit-covered; `make test-ios` additionally builds +
  runs the suite against the iOS SDK so the Views at least compile and link on
  both platforms. Transitions/AnimationTokens constants are pure data.

## Coverage target (LOCKED)

**≥ 85% line coverage** on every instrumentable file. A proxy exemption is permitted
ONLY for a specific file where no coverage tool can run; any such file MUST appear in
the `## Proxy exemptions` table below with a documented reason and asserted branch-ratio.

## AC-3 Resolution (QA, measured)

**Verdict: AC-3 MET.** Python measured via opportunistic coverage.py (or
behavioral gates when absent); Swift via llvm-cov measurement (jq gate); bash via
the q3 documented proxy because kcov is impractical on this platform.

### Skill scripts (in-process + CLI smoke — tests/python)

| Source file | Test methods | Coverage approach |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `skills/estimation-methodology/scripts/estimate-calc.py` | **21** | In-process importlib + CLI argparse smoke; band boundaries (10/11/15/17/18/20/25 + clamp-low), ai_cost arithmetic (sonnet 0.36 / haiku 0.0375), hours (M/senior 24-30 base, 27.6-34.5 buffered, sp 4-5), CLI JSON shape, `--self-test`, no-args rc=1, unknown-model rejection |
| `skills/appstore-screenshots/scripts/layout-calc.py` | **16** | In-process importlib + CLI argparse smoke; Layout A proportional geometry (iPhone 6.9), screenshot centering (19.5:9), Layout D > A, full-bleed passthrough (tvOS), mac 16:10 landscape, unknown layout/device rejection, `--self-test`, `--list-devices` |

The scripts are UNCHANGED (skill runtime contract). In-process testing asserts
true contracts (unknown-model → sonnet fallback, unknown-layout → ValueError)
rather than subprocess approximations. Each script's built-in `--self-test`
provides additional validation. Coverage measured via opportunistic coverage.py
when present (historical in-process: 94% / 92%); behavioral gates are the hard
requirement on clean clones.

### Python harness tests (stdlib unittest — benchmark/harness/tests)

| Package | Suite size | Coverage approach |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| `benchmark/harness` (benchmarkkit + benchmarklive) | 202 tests / 16 modules | opportunistic coverage.py |

Harness tests exercise the schema decoder (vendored history.json), rotation,
generators (real `swift test` on generated apps), deterministic/live pipelines,
budget/credential gates, prompt assembly, and stage attribution — all with
injected fakes, zero real LLM calls.

### Swift packages (llvm-cov — measured, jq gate ≥85%)

`make coverage` gates each package's aggregate line coverage (exclusions above):

| Package | Suite size |
|---------|-----------|
| `benchmark/ttt-template` (TicTacToeKit) | 48 tests / 10 suites |

Refresh numbers with `make coverage` (prints per-package percentages and fails
below COV_MIN).

### Bash / hooks (kcov UNUSABLE on this host → q3 assertion-density proxy)

kcov 43 is installed, but on macOS **bash 3.2** it mis-parses the scripts' `BASH_VERSINFO`
guards (`"set -euo pipefail … is not an integer"`) and a single `.bats` target ran >2 min
without completing. Per the LOCKED plan's open-question q3, where no coverage tool can run we
use the **assertion-density proxy**: every shell script has a dedicated test file with ≥3 real
scenario `@test`s (happy / edge / failure-exit) asserting its documented contracts.

- **45/45** shell scripts + hooks have a dedicated `.bats` file (path-keyed where basenames
  collide — `attachments-preseed.sh`/`attachments-preseed-test.sh` are two distinct scripts,
  each with its own file); **47/47** total deterministic targets covered (45 shell + 2
  Python). **Zero exemptions.**

#### Measured, not derived (this file's fifth correction this worktask)

**1022** `@test` assertions across **64** `.bats` files — the 50 script-dedicated files plus
14 meta / repo-invariant files. **Min 3 / avg ~16 / max 90** per file; the ≥3 rule has no
exceptions. Measured directly (`grep -c '^@test'` across `tests/**`), not derived by
arithmetic on a prior claim — this file drifted repeatedly across the worktask (`680`→`683`,
then a stale self-contradictory `683`/`53`, then `787`/`54` before the selection-matrix work
landed its own test file; the `4.0.7` `### Fixed` entry documents the earlier repairs), and
1022/64 is re-derived directly from the tree, not incremented from any prior claim.

R6 landed in `branch-name.sh.bats` (worktree rename, opt-out, ledger-based once-guard,
disclosure) and `fn-preflight.bats` (the new `branch-divergence` subcommand). DV's final
cycle then hardened the `fromjson?` audit-scan guard in `branch-name.sh`, `fn-preflight.sh`
and `refine-branch-target.sh` against well-formed non-object audit lines, adding cases to
those three files plus their test helpers.

Highest-density targets: `branch-name.sh` 90, `test-execution-gate` 85, `fn-preflight` 58,
`branch-lib` 54, `state-patch` 36, `refine-branch-target` 31, `attach-visual-evidence` 25,
`test-helper` 23, `pr-body-lint` 19, `milestone-helpers` 26, `scan-secrets` 17,
`test-selection` 17.

#### Regeneration and enforcement

**These counts are regenerated, never incremented** — they and `tests/README.md`'s had drifted apart
(34/34 here against 36/36 there, both wrong). Re-derive with the commands recorded in
`tests/README.md § Bash`; both documents must be regenerated from the same run.

`tests/shell/meta/coverage-proxy.bats` enforces the first bullet as an **executable** gate: it walks
`hooks/*.sh`, `.claude/hooks/*.sh` and `skills/**/scripts/*.sh` and fails if any script lacks a
dedicated `.bats` with ≥3 `@test`. Its checker takes the repo root and tests root as arguments, so
its own failure paths (under-tested script, absent test file) are exercised against synthetic trees
rather than merely described. Dropping coverage now costs a reviewed diff.

To measure real bash line coverage, run `make coverage` on a **GNU/Linux** host (bash ≥4 +
kcov) where the `make coverage` target now works (the `$#`-expansion bug in the kcov stem
`sed` was fixed). On macOS the proxy above is the documented gate.

## Per-file coverage table (reference scaffold — kcov numbers populate on a Linux host)

> Instructions for QA: run `make coverage` on a clean checkout. For each `.bats` target,
> kcov reports the per-script `lines_valid / lines_covered / percent` in
> `.coverage-kcov/<stem>/index.json` (or the HTML). For each Python module, `coverage
> report` prints the per-module percent. Fill the table below.

| `skills/appstore-screenshots/scripts/layout-calc.py` | `tests/python/test_layout_calc.py` | 16 |

### Meta / repo-invariant tests (no single source script — not part of the 45)

These 14 files guard cross-cutting contracts, so they have no row in the tables above and are
excluded from the 45/45 denominator. They are counted in the 59 `.bats` / 879 `@test` totals.

| Test file | Contract guarded |
|-----------|------------------|
| `tests/shell/meta/coverage-proxy.bats` | Every shell script has a dedicated `.bats` with ≥3 `@test`; exemption list stays empty and cannot outlive its script |
| `tests/shell/meta/test-selection.bats` | The change→test dependency matrix — L1 resolver, `matrix.tsv` grammar (L2), the ALWAYS floor (L3), and the F1-F7 fail-closed triggers |
| `tests/shell/lib/test-helper.bats` | The frozen `test_helper.bash` API — child-only env mutation, stream splitting, stub/mock behaviour |
| `tests/shell/skills/test-authority-matrix.bats` | Stage test-execution authority table |
| `tests/shell/skills/cross-plugin-refs.bats` | Every cross-plugin command/agent reference resolves |
| `tests/shell/skills/plugin-root-refs.bats` | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` composed-token grammar (a **predicate**, not a frozen line count — see below) |
| `tests/shell/worktask/artifact-map-parity.bats` | Stage↔artifact map matches `ARTIFACT_RE` |
| `tests/shell/worktask/manifest-parity.bats` | `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` / filesystem / README version + registration parity |
| `tests/shell/worktask/local-path-regex-parity.bats` | The absolute-host-path strip rule is byte-identical in `publish-pl-issue-lib.sh` and `pr-body-lint.sh` |
| `tests/shell/worktask/gh-issue-dedup.bats` | Issue dedupe-anchor contract |
| `tests/shell/benchmark/run-benchmark.bats` | The paid-dispatch barrier — no `--live`, no spend |
| `tests/shell/benchmark/canvas-e2e-guards.bats` | Canvas E2E audit-row gate |

**Note for anyone editing docs:** `plugin-root-refs.bats` used to freeze a markdown line count at 5
and a literal whitelist of files, which made routine documentation edits red the suite. Both arms
were replaced by a grammar predicate over each occurrence plus explicit growth-tolerance tests, so
adding docs and agents no longer requires touching this test.

## Proxy exemptions (QA fills; each must name a specific file + reason)

> If any file's line coverage cannot be measured by kcov (e.g. the script relies on
> sourced aliases that confuse kcov's instrumentation, or is a macOS-only binary-wrapper
> that kcov can't trace on the CI host), document it here with:
>   1. The file path.
>   2. The specific reason kcov cannot instrument it.
>   3. The asserted-branch / total-branch ratio from the test file (the proxy ≥85% bar).
>
> Format: one row per file. A blanket "all scripts" exemption is NOT permitted (AC-3).

| File | kcov failure reason | Asserted/Total branches | Proxy % |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| (none filed at DV0d handoff — kcov 43 installed via brew; QA to fill if any file fails to instrument) | | | |

## How to refresh this table

```bash
make coverage
# kcov results:  .coverage-kcov/<stem>/index.json -> .percent_covered
# swift results: printed per package ([coverage] <pkg> line coverage: NN.N%)
```

Paste the per-file numbers into the tables above after each `make coverage` run.
The per-package gate (jq ≥85% for Swift; kcov threshold assertion for bash)
is enforced automatically; this table is the audit trail and exemption registry.

## Why there is no `make coverage-changed`

`./run-tests.sh --changed` runs a subset of the suite (see *Test Selection* in
`tests/README.md`). There is deliberately **no** scoped coverage target, and
`--changed --coverage` is a hard **exit 64** rather than a silent no-op.

kcov's denominator is `KCOV_INCLUDE := skills,hooks,.claude/hooks` — the **source**
set. It does not shrink when fewer tests run. So a scoped coverage run reduces the
numerator only, and the bash branch has no percentage gate that would catch the
drop: it would simply report a lower number that looks like a regression in the
code rather than in the measurement. The Swift branch does gate at ≥85%, so the
same subset would fail it for a reason unrelated to the change under test.

Coverage is therefore a **full-suite QA activity**, not a dev-loop one. If you
want coverage, run `make coverage`; if you want speed, run `make test-changed`.
Refusing the combination is the recorded decision — the alternative is a number
that is quietly wrong in the direction that looks like a real failure.
