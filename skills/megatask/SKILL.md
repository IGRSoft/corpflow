# Megatask

Executes a **batch** of single-issue worktasks: owns the issue set (a GitHub milestone or an
explicit `--issues` array), builds a **dependency/blocker DAG**, runs issues in **topological +
priority order**, each isolated in its own git worktree. One `/worktask` per issue; megatask never
runs stages itself.

> **Separation of concerns.** `/worktask` runs ONE issue's staged pipeline (PL→…→ST) and is
> milestone-agnostic. All milestone/array/DAG/track logic lives here — not in `worktask.md`.

## Canonical Scripts

Invoke these instead of reading the reference files in the happy path; the references stay the
authoritative spec. Each takes `--self-test` (no network, no side effects).

### `scripts/build-orchestrator.sh` — DAG builder

Reads pre-fetched issue JSON, extracts dependency edges, runs Kahn cycle detection, assigns levels,
computes `parallel_tracks`, emits `orchestrator.json v3.1` — the executable implementation of
`references/dependency-graph.md`. On a cycle: exit 1 naming the participating issues on stderr,
never an invented order.

#### Invocation — build-orchestrator

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megatask/scripts/build-orchestrator.sh \
  --file issues.json \
  --out  .worktrees/milestone-1/orchestrator.json \
  --group milestone-1 --milestone-num 1 --milestone-title "Sprint 1" \
  --base-branch develop

bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megatask/scripts/build-orchestrator.sh --self-test
```

Input schema: `[{ "issue": <int>, "title": "<str>", "labels": ["P0",...], "body": "<str>" }]`
Output: `orchestrator.json v3.1` — field contract in `references/schemas.md`.

### `scripts/init-worktree.sh` — per-issue worktree initialiser

For one issue: resolves the base branch, creates the worktree at `.worktrees/<group>/<issue#>`,
makes `.context/`, stamps `workspace.json v2.0` — the executable implementation of
`references/git-integration.md`. Branch naming and base-branch resolution are fully delegated to
`../shared/milestone-helpers/scripts/milestone-helpers.sh`; no slug or branch logic lives here.

#### Invocation — init-worktree

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megatask/scripts/init-worktree.sh \
  --issue 42 --title "Add login flow" --group milestone-1 \
  --track 1 --blocked-by 41 --blocks 60 --labels "P1,feature" \
  [--file issue-42.json]   # pre-fetched `gh issue view … --json body,labels`

bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megatask/scripts/init-worktree.sh --issue 42 --title "..." --group milestone-1 --dry-run
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megatask/scripts/init-worktree.sh --self-test
```

#### Behavior — init-worktree

Without `--file`, base-branch resolution calls git ls-remote (thin, optional). Idempotent:
re-running on an existing worktree path is a no-op. It excludes the batch's scratch metadata
(`/workspace.json`, `/.worktrees/`) via the git common dir's `info/exclude` *before* creating the
worktree, so an unscoped `git add -A` cannot stage it (`references/git-integration.md § Creation`).

#### Runtime twin

> `hooks/megatask-monitor.sh` (SubagentStop/Stop) owns the *completion* side — reconciling
> workspace.json outcomes back into orchestrator.json; these INIT scripts own *creation* only. Both
> sides agree on the `workspace.json v2.0` / `orchestrator.json v3.1` schemas in
> `references/schemas.md`.

### `scripts/resolve-pbxproj-membership.sh` — membershipExceptions conflict resolver

Resolves a conflict in an Xcode project file's synchronized-build-file
`membershipExceptions = ( … );` list by **sorted, deduplicated union** of both sides. Keeping only
one side unregisters test files: the build stays green and those tests silently never run again.

#### Invocation — resolve-pbxproj-membership

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megatask/scripts/resolve-pbxproj-membership.sh --file App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megatask/scripts/resolve-pbxproj-membership.sh --file <path> --dry-run   # prints result, writes nothing
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megatask/scripts/resolve-pbxproj-membership.sh --self-test
```

#### Behavior — resolve-pbxproj-membership

The one exception to § Conflict Resolution's hand-resolve rule, and only because it **refuses
everything it does not recognise**. Any of these refuses the **whole file** — exit 1 with
`refusing: <reason>`, file byte-identical (structurally: the parse writes a `mktemp` buffer and
`mv -f`s only on accept): a conflict elsewhere in the file; a comment or blank line inside a side;
nested or unterminated markers; a diff3 `|||||||` base section (an entry may have been deliberately
deleted — a union would resurrect it); a hunk spanning the list's `);`. Exit codes: 0 union written
/ no conflict / dry-run / self-test passed; 1 refusal or usage error; 2 `awk` missing. Rule 2 of
§ Conflict Resolution still applies: build and test before pushing.

## Inputs

`N` (bare integer) ⇒ milestone; `--issues 12,15,18` ⇒ explicit set (may span milestones); together,
`--issues` filters within milestone `N`. At least one is required. Full flag surface:
`../../commands/megatask.md § Usage`. Cross-issue concurrency is orchestrator-derived (§ Track
Derivation); intra-issue async (DV0 splitting into DV0/DV1/…) belongs to each issue's TL stage.

## Dependency & Blocker Resolution (DAG)

Megatask's core addition over plain priority batching: **inter-issue relationships** executed as a
directed acyclic graph rather than a flat priority list.

| Edge | Parsed from issue body | Meaning |
|------|------------------------|---------|
| `A blocked_by B` | `Depends on: #B` on issue A | A cannot start until B is `completed` |
| `A blocks B` | `Blocks: #B` on issue A | reverse of `B Depends on A` |

Both formats are what `/milestone` emits under `## Dependencies`. The two directions **normalize**
into one edge set (`A blocks B` ⇔ `B blocked_by A`); duplicates collapse. Edges leaving the resolved
issue set become `external_dependency` warnings — surfaced, never gating (out of batch scope).

### Ordering

1. **Cycle detection** (Kahn's algorithm). Any cycle ⇒ STOP and report the participating issues. Never guess an order.
2. **Topological sort** — issues with empty `blocked_by` form level 0; removing them exposes level 1; etc.
3. **Priority tiebreak** within a level: `P0`/`priority:critical` → `P1`/`high` → `P2`/`medium` → `P3`/`low` → unlabeled; FIFO by issue number within a tier.

An issue is **ready** only when every `blocked_by[]` entry is `completed` (PR merged, or created
when the project closes via PR): megatask **never starts an issue whose blockers are unmerged.**
Algorithm, worked example, levelled schedule: `references/dependency-graph.md`.

## Workspace Architecture

Each issue executes in its own git worktree with its own branch checked out — no `git checkout`
switching, so issues run truly in parallel. `<group>` is `milestone-{N}` or `issues-{shortid}`
(array mode).

```
.worktrees/<group>/orchestrator.json   # root orchestrator state (DAG + tracks + progress)
.worktrees/<group>/{issue#}/           # worktree root: full source copy + .git link file
    .context/                          # per-issue worktask artifacts
    workspace.json                     # workspace metadata (isolation: "worktree")
    handoff.md                         # compressed context
```

> Add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` so worktree contents do not appear as untracked. Sub-agents in
> an isolated worktree get Read/Edit access to it with no explicit `tools:` grant.

#### Sparse Checkout

For large monorepos, configure `worktree.sparsePaths` in project `settings.json` to check out only
relevant directories — less per-worktree disk, faster init:

```json
{ "worktree": { "sparsePaths": ["src/", "tests/", "Package.swift"] } }
```

#### Including gitignored paths (`.worktreeinclude`)

`.worktreeinclude` names paths to carry into a new worktree even when gitignored. A pattern
starting with `**/` no longer silently matches nothing when its target lives inside a gitignored
directory — before that fix such a line looked correct and copied nothing.

A background session and its subagents can now edit files inside a worktree the session created
itself with `git worktree add`; the isolation check used to block that and stall the lane.

### Unattended Execution

A batch cannot stop for one issue's approvals, so every per-issue `PL0` is stamped
`plan_gate: "bypass"`, `fn_gate: "bypass"` (both default `"checkpoint"`) and `decision_gate: "auto"`
(default `"user"`) — that issue's `open_questions[]` route through the Fable decision pass
(`commands/worktask.md § Step A.4`). The single human checkpoint is megatask's own **R1 batch
confirmation**, before any worktree exists; per-issue changes are reviewable as per-issue PRs.

#### Parking an escalate-class question

Escalate-class questions are never auto-decided — they **PARK that single issue** while the batch
continues with the remaining unblocked issues. Parking needs no new state: it settles
`execution.status: "failed"` + `execution.reason: "parked_escalation"` with an `escalation_parked`
audit row, so the monitor frees the track and dependents stay `blocked`, and the batch summary lists
each parked issue with its unanswered questions. Mechanics:
`../../commands/megatask.md § Step 3 — parking mechanics`.

##### Parking — non-planning stages

The same path covers non-planning stages: an escalate-class closing-sweep item parks the issue
identically, with the audit subject set to the boundary that surfaced it — `FN<N>` for a batched
item, the emitting stage's own `<CODE><N>` for one marked `blocks_next_stage`
(`skills/shared/stage-contracts.md § Closing Elicitation Sweep`).

> For headless `-p` runs, set `MCP_CONNECTION_NONBLOCKING=true` to skip the MCP connection wait;
> with `--mcp-config`, server connections are bounded at 5s rather than blocking on the slowest.

## Track Derivation

`parallel_tracks` is computed at init and re-derived as blockers merge, into
`orchestrator.json → configuration.parallel_tracks`. Never a flag/default.

```
parallel_tracks = min( count(currently-ready issues), 5 )
parallel_tracks = reduce_by_disk_capacity(parallel_tracks)   # each worktree duplicates the tree
parallel_tracks = reduce_by_concurrency_cap(parallel_tracks) # CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS (20)
# single explicit issue ( /megatask --issues 12 ) ⇒ 1
```

### Subagent spawn budget

> Each issue dispatches ~9–11 stage subagents (9-stage default, 11-stage `--secure`) plus nested delegation (DV → platform agent → Tier-2 specialist, QA → `test-generator`). CC 2.1.224 removed the per-session total-spawn cap: batch size is **no longer bounded by a running count** — no ~18/~22-issue ceiling, no env var to raise. What still refuses a dispatch is **concurrency** (`agent-coordination § Two independent ceilings`) and, below it, disk for the worktrees and your rate budget. Size batches against peak concurrency, not a total.

### Concurrency budget

> **20 subagents may run concurrently** by default (`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS`) — a cap distinct from spawn total and depth. Subagents are background-by-default, so live population ≈ `parallel_tracks × (1 orchestrator + 1 stage agent + its nested children)`; at `parallel_tracks = 5` with routine Tier-2 delegation that approaches the cap. Track derivation bounds itself against this ceiling; raise the env var only when disk and rate budgets also allow it.

### Nesting-depth budget

> **`/megatask` spends one depth level before any stage runs.** Phase 2 Step 3 delegates a per-issue `/worktask` orchestrator as its own sub-agent, so the chain sits one level deeper than a standalone worktask at every point:

| Level | Standalone `/worktask` | Under `/megatask` |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | session | session |
| 1 | stage agent (`corpflow:developer`) | per-issue `/worktask` orchestrator |
| 2 | platform router (`apple-developer:apple-developer`) | stage agent (`corpflow:developer`) |
| 3 | Tier-2 specialist (`apple-developer:test-generator`) | platform router |
| 4 | — | Tier-2 specialist ⚠️ **past the default ceiling** |

#### Depth remediations

> Default cap **3** (`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH`). A batch whose DV stages route through a platform router to a Tier-2 specialist loses that last delegation — the specialist is never spawned and the platform agent does the work itself. Two remediations:
>
> 1. **Raise the cap** (preferred — preserves routing): export `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH=4` (higher for `--secure` batches that also nest under SR) before starting the batch.
> 2. **Flatten Tier-2** (no config required): DV dispatches the platform specialist directly (`apple-developer:ios-developer`) instead of the router, reclaiming one level at the cost of the router's platform-detection step.
>
> The R1 gate reports the batch's projected max depth, so the choice precedes any worktree.

#### One formula, two callers

> The level table above is canonical; `skills/worktask/SKILL.md § Validation check 11` applies it per-stage for standalone worktasks, differing only in `orchestrator_offset` (1 here, 0 standalone). The same chain must project **3** standalone and **4** under `/megatask` — editing one column without the other is how the two drift. An unanticipated hop, which neither projection can see, is caught afterwards by `agent-coordination § Depth-refusal self-report`.

## Status Transitions

```
pending → ready → in_progress → completed
                              → failed
        → blocked  (blocked_by not yet all completed)
        → skipped / skipped_has_pr
```

### Issue status values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | resolved, not yet scheduled |
| `blocked` | `blocked_by` not all completed |
| `ready` | all blockers completed; eligible for a track |
| `in_progress` | worktree active |
| `completed` | PR created |
| `skipped` / `skipped_has_pr` | manually skipped / already has a linked PR (auto-detected) |
| `failed` | max retries exceeded, or parked on unanswered escalate-class questions (`workspace.json.execution.reason: "parked_escalation"`) |

### Starting and completing an issue

**Starting**: set `in_progress`, assign `track`, create worktree + branch, begin the per-issue
worktask (PL→…→ST) with gates pre-bypassed.

**Completing**: per-issue FN pushes the branch, opens a PR with `Closes #{issue}`, and writes
`execution.status: "completed"` + `execution.pr` into `workspace.json` (completion contract:
`references/schemas.md`). The monitor hook reads that, marks the issue `completed` in
`orchestrator.json`, **unblocks dependents**, and frees the track. A `failed` issue writes
`execution.status: "failed"` — its dependents stay `blocked`.

## Per-Track Task IDs

Every track uses the same plain `<STAGE>0` ledger keys (`PL0`, `AR0`, `DV0`, `DR0`, `QA0`). The
namespace is the **worktree**, not the key: each track has its own `.context/state.json` under its
own worktree, so two tracks both writing `PL0` cannot collide. Track-offset ids would additionally
break every hardcoded `PL0`/`AR0`/`FN0` reader and the `PL is always PL0 only` rule in
`../shared/state-ledger.md`.

### Seeding a track's PL

`/worktask` Step 3a seeds the per-issue ledger with `seed-state.sh`
(`commands/worktask.md § Steps 3–3a`); it already holds `tasks.PL0`, so this row is a metadata merge.

```bash
# megatask bypasses both default-checkpoint gates; decision_gate=auto means open
# questions go to a Fable decision pass and an escalation parks the issue.
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/worktask/scripts/state-patch.sh --task-meta "PL0" --set "$(jq -n \
  --argjson issue "$ISSUE_NUMBER" --argjson track "$TRACK" \
  --arg group "$GROUP" --arg ms "$MILESTONE_OR_EMPTY" \
  '{stage:"PL", agent:"corpflow:product-manager",
    description:"Planning - Issue #\($issue)",
    issue_number:$issue, track:$track,
    workspace_path:".worktrees/\($group)/\($issue)",
    isolation:"worktree",
    megatask_group:$group, milestone:(if $ms == "" then null else $ms end),
    fn_gate:"bypass", plan_gate:"bypass",
    decision_gate:"auto"}')"
```

## Base Branch Resolution

Per-issue fallback chain (stored in `workspace.json` as `base_branch_source`):
1. **Issue body**: parse `base_branch: <branch>`
2. **Develop fallback**: if `develop` exists on remote
3. **Master default**: fall back to `master`

## Branch Naming

`<type>/{issue#}-{slug}` — type derived from the issue title (`feature` by default, `bugfix`
for a defect, …); slug = lowercase title, spaces→hyphens, no special chars, max 50 chars,
truncated on a word boundary. Canonical definition: `../shared/milestone-helpers/SKILL.md`.

## Shared-Seam Registry

A **seam** is a code surface more than one issue in the batch touches by name: a shared protocol, a
dependency-injection extension point, a coordinator, or a shared test assertion. Parallel tickets
cannot see each other's work in progress, so two of them independently invent the same abstraction
under different names unless one place tells them it already exists. The dependency graph cannot
catch this class — the tickets are genuinely independent; only their *seams* collide.

### Registry location

**Exactly one registry per batch**, in an issue body under a `## Shared Seams` H2 — an issue body
already exists, is already fetched at dispatch, and needs no lifecycle. The host is a rule, not a
judgement call: two hosts reproduce the very failure this prevents, each ticket reading a different
registry and concluding no seam exists.

| Batch shape | Registry host |
|---|---|
| Exactly one level-0 issue (no `blocked_by`) — the **foundation issue**, the one every other issue transitively depends on | that issue's body |
| More than one level-0 issue, or none | the **milestone issue** (milestone mode) or the **orchestrator issue** (`--issues` array mode) |

**Convention, not a gate.** Nothing validates the registry this release; its force comes from the
per-issue prompt directing every issue to read it before introducing a shared abstraction
(`../../commands/megatask.md § Phase 2 loop · Step 3`).

### Registry schema

One block per seam. `declaration` carries the **verbatim** signature with every parameter label in
order — a name-only entry would not catch two issues agreeing on a concept but reversing an argument
order. `consumers:` plus `change-protocol:` are what make an additive change safe: adding a member
to a shared protocol silently breaks every test double conforming to it, and the adder is the only
party positioned to know.

#### Registry entry — canonical shape

````markdown
## Shared Seams

### NotificationDestinationPresence
- kind: protocol | di-extension-point | coordinator | test-contract
- status: planned | landed
- owner: #<issue that introduces it>
- consumers: #<issue>, #<issue>
- location: <path/to/File.swift>
- declaration:
  ```swift
  protocol NotificationDestinationPresence {
      func setPresented(_ presented: Bool, for destination: Destination)
  }
  ```
- change-protocol: adding or reordering a member requires updating this entry in the same PR
  and naming every issue in `consumers:` in that PR's description.
````

## Orchestrator Pattern

### Initialization

1. Create `.worktrees/<group>/`; resolve the issue set (milestone fetch or per-issue
   `gh issue view`), dropping closed / `skipped_has_pr` ones.
2. Build the DAG (`references/dependency-graph.md`) — cycles STOP; compute topological + priority
   order; **derive** `parallel_tracks` (§ Track Derivation).
3. Write `orchestrator.json` (schema v3.1) with the DAG, order, and tracks.
4. Run the **R1 batch confirmation gate**, then create worktrees and start the first ready issues.

### Monitoring Loop

**Completion-driven** via `hooks/megatask-monitor.sh` (registered SubagentStop/Stop):

1. **On per-issue completion** — the hook marks the issue `completed` in `orchestrator.json`,
   removes it from every dependent's `blocked_by[]`, promotes now-unblocked dependents to `ready`,
   frees the track, and writes a `megatask_progress` audit row (+ optional notification).
2. **Orchestrator turn** — re-read `orchestrator.json`, re-derive `parallel_tracks`, assign freed
   tracks to ready issues (topological + priority order), launch their worktasks.
3. **Errors** — a `failed` issue frees its track but keeps its dependents permanently `blocked`;
   surface the blocked set so the user can intervene (retry, re-scope, or drop the edge).
4. **Stage creation** — verify each per-issue `PL0` created its subsequent stages.

#### Hook properties

Non-blocking (always exits 0) and **self-skips** when no `orchestrator.json` is present, so plain
single-issue worktasks are untouched. Optional agent-teams event model (`TeammateIdle` /
`TaskCompleted`): `references/agent-teams.md`.

## Execution Flow

The three modes differ only in issue-set resolution — milestone fetch, `gh issue view` per issue
(group `issues-{shortid}`), or milestone ∩ explicit set. All then execute identically: build the DAG
and sort → R1 gate → init `parallel_tracks` worktrees → each runs independently → on completion open
the PR, unblock dependents, assign the next ready issue. Phase-by-phase procedure and the resolution
commands: `../../commands/megatask.md § Phase 1`, `§ Phase 2`.

Track count is orchestrator-derived (max 5) and gated by the DAG — only ready issues consume tracks,
so a deep chain (A→B→C→D→E) runs effectively serially however many tracks exist.

## Conflict Resolution

Parallel branches off one base collide on shared files. Two rules are binding for every conflict
a batch produces.

### Rule 1 — hand-resolve DI and coordinator shapes

**Dependency-injection containers and coordinator-shaped files are hand-resolved by a human;
never script-merge them.** Any "keep both sides" automation is forbidden on these shapes: a
registration list, a DI container extension, a coordinator's argument list, or a switch over
destinations. Observed failure: a scripted keep-both-sides join dropped an argument separator and
duplicated a closing brace twice; both survived review and were caught only by a later build.

A script is allowed only where its conflict class needs no interpretation *and* the script refuses
everything it does not recognise (§ Canonical Scripts names any such tool the batch ships). Absent
that, this rule stands.

### Rule 2 — build and test before pushing

**Build and test after every conflict resolution, before pushing.** Not a read-through, not a
syntax check — the real build and the real test run, from the worktree. Rule 1's failure mode is
invisible to everything cheaper.

### Recovery when the branch cannot be re-pushed

Rebase, push under a new name, open a replacement PR, close the superseded one:
`references/git-integration.md § Conflict Recovery`.

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Workspace Action | Orchestrator Action |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Transient | Retry (3×) | Monitor |
| Fatal | Mark `failed` | Free track; keep dependents `blocked`; alert user |
| Dependency cycle | — | STOP at init; report participating issues |

**Global errors**: milestone not found, issue not in milestone/set, rate limit, dependency cycle.
