# Headless Dispatch — `claude agents` Flag Bridge

The contract mapping `task.metadata` to `claude agents run` CLI flags, for external orchestrators (CI runners, batch schedulers, the user's shell) invoking a worktask stage outside the in-process `Task()` path.

The corpflow orchestrator dispatches every stage in-process via `Task({ subagent_type, model, prompt })`; the flags below are honoured only by a CLI dispatch. PL0 populates the fields anyway, so every dispatcher — in-process or CLI — reads one source of truth.

## Translation Table

| `task.metadata` key | CLI flag | Type | Honoured in-process? | Stage examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent` | `--agent <name>` | string | N/A (in-process uses `Task({subagent_type})`) | overrides the session's `settings.json` `agent` default; e.g. force `corpflow:developer` for a one-shot run |
| `--all` (listing flag, not a `metadata` key) | `claude agents --all` | bool | N/A (listing only) | includes **completed** sessions in `claude agents [--json]` output; pair with `state` to tell `done` apart from `running`/`blocked` |

### Translation table — model & effort

#### Model assignment

| `task.metadata` key | CLI flag | Type | Honoured in-process? | Stage examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | `--model <alias>` | string | **Yes** (passed to `Task()`) | DV→`opus`; QA/FN→`sonnet` |

A managed `availableModels` allowlist also constrains subagent overrides, and `enforceAvailableModels` the Default model, so a requested id may silently resolve to another. Benchmark-parity snapshots use pinned ids (§ Alias note); audit rather than assume.

#### Effort tier assignment

| `task.metadata` key | CLI flag | Type | Honoured in-process? | Stage examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `effort` | `--effort <tier>` | `low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max` | Advisory | DV complex→`xhigh`; DR→`high`; FN→`medium`; RE→`low` |

`claude agents --effort` also accepts `ultracode`, which is not a plugin `metadata.effort` tier; the plugin enum stays `low/medium/high/xhigh/max`. A managed or user `maxEffortLevel` caps effort on every provider — a tier pinned above the cap runs at the cap with no error.

### Translation table — permission, workspace & MCP

| `task.metadata` key | CLI flag | Type | Honoured in-process? | Stage examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `permission_mode` | `--permission-mode <mode>` | `default\|acceptEdits\|plan\|bypassPermissions` | **Yes — audited** (§ Permission-Mode Pinning) | SR/FN→`default`; DV under `--auto=[plan]`→`bypassPermissions`. The CLI's choices are `acceptEdits\|auto\|bypassPermissions\|manual\|dontAsk\|plan`, with no `default`: pass plugin `default` as `manual`. `auto` and `dontAsk` are CLI-only values, not plugin `metadata.permission_mode` tiers |
| `workspace_path` | `--cwd <path>` | string | N/A (in-process inherits parent cwd) | megatask tracks → per-issue worktree |
| `add_dirs` (array) | repeated `--add-dir <path>` | string[] | N/A | cross-repo work, monorepo siblings |
| `mcp_config_path` | `--mcp-config <path>` | string | N/A | scoped MCP set per dispatch |

### Translation table — plugins, skip-permissions & settings

| `task.metadata` key | CLI flag | Type | Honoured in-process? | Stage examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `plugin_dir_overrides` (array) | repeated `--plugin-dir <path>` | string[] | N/A | local plugin development; a path may name a folder of plugins, and each child folder with a manifest loads |
| `dangerously_skip_permissions` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | bool | Advisory; orchestrator may refuse | CI batch only, with a deny-list in `settings.json` |
| `settings_path` | `--settings <path>` | string | N/A | provider / org config swap |

### Advisory vs audited legend

"Advisory" = recorded on the task and read by external dispatchers, but the in-process `Task()` tool has no equivalent parameter. "Audited" = the orchestrator writes an `audit.jsonl` line when the field is set, though it cannot enforce the mode on a `Task()` child.

## Per-Stage Recommended Flag Sets

One canonical invocation; substitute the per-stage row plus concrete IDs from `task.metadata` at call time.

```bash
claude agents run --cwd "$WORKTREE" --model "$MODEL" --effort "$EFFORT" \
  --permission-mode "$MODE" -- "$AGENT" < "$PROMPT"
```

Neither `claude agents run` nor a top-level `--cwd` exists on the CLI as last probed (§ Dispatch surface drift): read the one-liner as the flag mapping, not a runnable command, until it is re-derived.

| Stage | `$AGENT` | `$MODE` |
|---|---|---|
| **DV** | `corpflow:developer` | `bypassPermissions` |
| **DR** | `corpflow:technical-lead` | `acceptEdits` |
| **SR** | `corpflow:security-reviewer` | `default` |
| **QA** | `corpflow:qa-engineer` | `acceptEdits` |
| **FN** | `corpflow:project-manager` | `default` |
| **RE** | `corpflow:release-engineer` | `default` |
| **ST** | `corpflow:stakeholder` | `acceptEdits` |

### Model & effort defaults

`$MODEL` and `$EFFORT` come from `skills/shared/stage-codes.md § Agent Model Matrix` (a two-hop join: § Primary Stages resolves the stage to its agent, the matrix resolves that agent to its pair; § Secure overrides under `--secure` or `--full` replaces the resolved pair outright, so it can also lower a pair `CORPFLOW.md` raised). Pass the model as the alias; the pinned ids in § Alias note are for benchmark-parity runs only. Override per task when `metadata.model` / `metadata.effort` are set. `benchmark/harness/benchmarklive/stage_table.py` mirrors those rows as the machine-checked SSOT; model rules (aliases, cost tiers, the effort ladder) stay in `skills/shared/model-selection.md`.

### Alias note

Benchmark-parity pins: `opus` → `claude-opus-5`, `sonnet` → `claude-sonnet-5`. They sit deliberately behind the aliases (`opus` resolves to Opus 5.5, `skills/shared/model-selection.md § Aliases`) because they match `STAGE_TABLE` in `benchmark/harness/benchmarklive/stage_table.py`, whose per-stage pins stamp every record's comparability era. Moving them opens a new era that is not comparable to the stored baselines (`benchmark/README.md § Comparability eras`), so they move only with a benchmark re-baseline, never as a docs refresh. Everywhere else, including a production headless dispatch, pass the alias.

### Runner-side reliability

- The `stream-json` init event carries `mcp_server_errors` — the `--mcp-config` entries the validator skipped. A runner depending on a scoped MCP set (`metadata.mcp_config_path`) reads it at init rather than discovering the gap at the first `mcp__<server>__*` call. `claude mcp list` / `/mcp` report HTTP status and error text on failed connections.
- With `--forward-subagent-text`, depth-2+ subagents appear in the stream keyed by their spawning Agent `tool_use` id, so per-stage token attribution sees nested Tier-2 work instead of folding it into the parent stage.
- A turn dying on a mid-stream API error keeps the text `claude -p` already produced — salvage the partial work instead of treating the dispatch as empty.

#### Background-worker & env reliability

Background sessions do not inherit another session's `ANTHROPIC_*` env; they preserve a shell-exported `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, inherit the dispatching shell's `PATH`, honor `effortLevel` when forked through the daemon, and follow `CLAUDE_CODE_EXTRA_BODY`. A login-expiry warning fires before interruption, so a runner can re-auth ahead of the cut-off; gateway-auth jobs (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) survive daemon respawns.

#### Unattended-runner resilience

`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES` is capped at 15; for unattended batches set `CLAUDE_CODE_RETRY_WATCHDOG` instead — it raises the default retry count for non-capacity transient errors to 300 and lifts the cap. The streaming idle watchdog is on by default for all providers: a stream silent for 5 minutes aborts and retries (`CLAUDE_ENABLE_STREAM_WATCHDOG=0` disables). Transient 429s unrelated to the usage limit retry automatically with backoff for subscribers.

#### Structured output & MCP auth

`--json-schema` structured output suits dispatch pipelines (schema-validation failures abort after 5 attempts). Authenticate MCP servers up front with `claude mcp login <name>` / `claude mcp logout <name>` (`--no-browser` completes over SSH). `claude agents --dangerously-skip-permissions` shows the bypass disclaimer and applies bypass mode to spawned agents.

#### Print-mode (`claude -p`) runners

`--permission-prompts none` makes an unattended runner deny anything that would prompt instead of hanging, while the active permission mode decides the rest. It is a print-mode flag, not a `claude agents` flag and not a ledger field. `claude -p` waits for a Monitor the model armed to fire or time out before exiting. Background commands a subagent starts have no time cap and run until they exit or are stopped, so a runner stops them explicitly. A `cd` persists across turns in non-interactive sessions.

## Live Session Discovery

`claude agents --json` returns a JSON array of currently live Claude sessions — poll it to discover what is already running, complementing the dispatch table above, which covers how to start something. Canonical orchestrator shell-out, scoped to one worktask track:

```bash
claude agents --json | jq -r --arg track "$TRACK_ID" '
  .[] | select(.metadata.worktask_track == $track) | .agent_id'
```

### Usage patterns

- **Resume pre-check** — before respawning a subagent during resume, query live sessions; if any `agent_id` from `.context/state.json.facts.dispatched_agents[]` still appears, reattach via `SendMessage` instead of re-delegating (`skills/worktask/references/resume.md § Resume Procedure` step 0).
- **Parallel track health** — `claude agents --json | jq '[.[] | select(.tag=="corpflow-track")] | length'` should equal the orchestrator-derived `parallel_tracks`. Less = stalled track.
- **Status-line integration** — drives tmux / status-bar widgets showing the active stage without polluting `.context/`.

The JSON schema is not formally versioned — guard every read with defensive jq (`.parent_agent_id // "none"`); see § Schema Versioning Watch.

### Schema Versioning Watch

#### Recorded baseline (CC 2.1.169)

Array of objects with these observed top-level fields:

- Required: `session_id` (string), `agent_type` (string), `agent_id` (string), `started_at` (ISO-8601 string)
- Optional: `parent_agent_id` (string), `cwd` (string), `tag` (string), `metadata` (object), `waitingFor` (string — what a live session is blocked on, e.g. `approval`/`input`; empty/null = busy mid-work), `id` (string — stable session identifier), `state` (string — lifecycle phase, e.g. `running`/`blocked`/`done`)

Rows also render a `done/total` progress count in the human-readable (non-`--json`) listing.

#### `--all` semantics

`claude agents [--json] --all` includes completed sessions (otherwise filtered out); blocked and just-dispatched sessions are always listed. With `state`, a resume scan can tell a `blocked` agent (reattach via `SendMessage`) from a genuinely absent one (re-delegate) (`skills/worktask/references/resume.md § Resume Procedure` step 0).

#### "Needs input" status axis

Sessions parked on a sandbox approval, an MCP elicitation/input request, or a managed-settings prompt report as "Needs input" rather than busy/"Working". The exact JSON field/value is unconfirmed (possibly a new `waitingFor` value, possibly a separate flag); until a watch run pins it, treat any such session as parked on us (same bucket as `waitingFor: approval/input`), never as busy. These parks are operator-owned (`skills/worktask/references/resume.md § Live-agent rows`). The watch run that pins the field updates this entry.

#### Defensive-read rule for optional fields

`waitingFor`, `id` and `state` are read defensively (`.waitingFor // empty`, `.id // ""`, `.state // ""`); additive optional fields do not bump min CC (§ If the baseline shifts covers only required, renamed or type-changed fields). The resume loop branches directly on `{agent_id, state, waitingFor}`.

#### Watch protocol for future /cc-update runs

In any cc-update whose CC version delta touches the `claude agents` CLI surface, the prompt-engineer runs `claude agents --json | jq 'first | keys'`, diffs the key list against the recorded baseline and the observed drift below, and surfaces any drift as a Q for the operator.

#### Observed drift — interactive rows

Interactive rows diverge from the baseline (unannounced, first seen on CC 2.1.175). As last probed (CC 2.1.280, unchanged since 2.1.270) they carry exactly `{pid, cwd, kind: "interactive", startedAt, sessionId, name, status}`: camelCase `sessionId`, `startedAt` as an epoch-millis number, a `kind` discriminator, `name` (the readable session name — also the `SendMessage`/`/rename` address, and the key a session's own name reuses), `status` (e.g. `"busy"`), and no `agent_id`, `id`, `state` or `waitingFor`. The resume identity chain `agent_id // id // sessionId` tolerates the missing ids.

#### Open: dispatched-agent and teammate rows

Unconfirmed whether rows with `kind` ≠ `interactive` keep the snake_case baseline, and what `kind` a teammate row carries: no such row was live at any probe. Release notes (2.1.234→2.1.251) say live teammates appear in `ListAgents`/`claude agents --json` and the pre-warmed idle worker stays hidden until a task claims it. Until pinned: (a) coalesce both spellings in every read (§ Defensive jq pattern); (b) filter by `kind` before matching resume rows; (c) expect the resume pre-check to degrade safely to "absent → re-delegate" when fields read null.

#### Dispatch surface drift

`claude agents run` is not a subcommand — `claude agents run --help` prints `claude agents` usage (through 2.1.280). Top-level `claude` accepts `--bg`, `--model`, `--effort`, `--permission-mode`, `--add-dir`, `--plugin-dir`, `--settings` and `--mcp-config` but no `--cwd`, so an external dispatcher must `cd` into the worktree first. Re-deriving the external one-liner is an open follow-up.

#### Defensive jq pattern

Canonical for any plugin code reading this output:

```jq
.[] | {
  session:    (.session_id // .sessionId // "unknown"),   # camelCase observed on 2.1.175
  kind:       (.kind // "agent"),                          # "interactive" rows are NOT dispatched agents — filter before matching
  parent:     (.parent_agent_id // .parentAgentId // "none"),
  tag:        (.tag // "untagged"),
  waiting_for: (.waitingFor // ""),  # "" = busy mid-work; "approval"/"input" = parked on us
  state:       (.state // "")        # "running"/"blocked"/"done"
}
```

#### If the baseline shifts

On a baseline shift (new required field, renamed field, type change), the next cc-update bumps the min CC version and adds a migration note to the relevant `cc-features-<from>-<to>.md` band file.

#### Child tool grants: `--tools`, MCP denials & WebSearch

`--tools` listing `Grep`/`Glob` wires up dedicated native search tools rather than shelling out — relevant only to a runner hand-building the `--tools` set; the in-process `Task()` path inherits agent-frontmatter `tools:` unchanged. A subagent's `disallowedTools` honors MCP server-level specs (`mcp__server`, `mcp__*`), so a cross-plugin dispatch can deny a whole server to a child. `WebSearch` works inside subagents (~200 calls/session, `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_WEB_SEARCHES_PER_SESSION` tunes it). Auth-capable MCP servers hide auth-stub tools from headless / SDK runs.

## Session Lifecycle CLI (attach / logs / stop / respawn / rm)

`claude attach <id>` attaches a terminal to a running background session; `--resume` is for a stopped conversation, and its message prints the exact `attach` command when the target is still running. `logs`, `stop`, `respawn` and `rm` complete the surface (`claude --help`).

### Operator tools vs orchestrator reattach

These are operator tools for human debugging. The orchestrator's reattach path stays `SendMessage` (`skills/worktask/references/resume.md`).

### Resume and cleanup behavior

`claude --resume <session-id> --bg` continues that session under its own ID when nothing is running it, so a recorded `dispatched_agents[]` id stays valid; when a copy starts instead, the CLI announces it. A background session whose machine was off shows as stopped at its real end and asks before resuming. `claude agents`/`claude rm` delete a session whose worktree branch was merged locally but not pushed.

## Permission-Mode Pinning (in-process)

When the orchestrator reads `task.metadata.permission_mode === "default"` for a stage, it does not propagate `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or any equivalent shorthand into descendant `Task()` calls or nested `Bash` invocations for that stage, and it appends one `audit.jsonl` line:

```json
{
  "ts": "<ISO-8601 UTC>",
  "actor": "orchestrator",
  "action": "permission_mode_pinned",
  "subject": "<task_id>",
  "result": "ok",
  "metadata": { "stage": "<code>", "mode": "default" }
}
```

Subagents inherit the parent session's permission mode (the Task tool's deprecated `mode` parameter is ignored), so pinning is about not widening the inherited mode — the audit line records that the boundary held. Every other flag above is advisory in-process and takes effect only on a CLI dispatch.

## External-Dispatch Audit Hook

A headless runner invoking a stage from the CLI appends one line to the same worktask's `.context/logs/audit.jsonl`:

```json
{
  "ts": "<ISO-8601 UTC>",
  "actor": "external:<runner-name>",
  "action": "external_dispatch",
  "subject": "<task_id>",
  "result": "ok",
  "task_id": "<task_id>",
  "metadata": {
    "invoker": "<ci|cron|user-shell>",
    "agent": "<plugin:agent>",
    "flags": ["--model=…", "--effort=…", "--permission-mode=…", "--cwd=…"]
  }
}
```

Without it the post-worktask audit cannot tell in-process delegation from CLI dispatch, which matters for cost attribution, security review and reproducibility.

## Anti-Patterns

- Passing `--dangerously-skip-permissions` from an interactive session — it is for headless CI runs that already carry a deny-list (`permissions.deny`, `autoMode.hard_deny`) in `settings.json`; interactively, let the permission UI handle prompts.
- Pointing `--cwd` and `task.metadata.workspace_path` at different paths — resolve one canonical worktree directory and pass it consistently.
- Setting `dangerously_skip_permissions: true` on PL/SR/FN tasks: human review is the point of a gated stage. PL0 should reject such metadata at validation time.
- Treating CLI flags as a replacement for agent-frontmatter `tools:` restrictions — flags configure the session, frontmatter restricts the agent; both apply.

### FN-gate race

Background agents launched from `claude agents` auto commit, push and open a draft PR when they finish code work in a worktree, instead of stopping to ask. For gated worktasks, scope headless DV dispatches to implementation only (no push-capable permission mode or credentials) so commit/push/PR stays with the FN stage behind `fn_gate`. Megatask lanes stamp per-issue `fn_gate: "bypass"`, so lane auto-PR is by design there.

## Background Shell Dispatch

Two ways to spawn background shell work without occupying a foreground agent turn, besides a CLI agent dispatch. Choose by whether you need agent reasoning (an agent dispatch) or just a shell side-effect.

- **`! <command>`** — inside a running session, prefixing a shell command with `!` (e.g. `! swift build 2>&1 | tail -20`) runs it in a background shell and delivers stdout/stderr into session context on completion. Unlike a `Bash` tool call it does not block the turn.
- **`claude --bg --exec '<command>'`** — from outside a session, a one-shot background command that exits on completion, e.g. `claude --bg --exec 'cd "$WORKTREE" && swift build > .context/build.log 2>&1'`. For CI/cron jobs needing Claude's tool environment but no interactive agent; combine with `--model` or `--permission-mode`, and `cd` inside the command since there is no `--cwd`.
