# Cross-Session Messaging — SendMessage Reach, Authority & Delivery

Read when a stage messages a peer session: who `SendMessage` reaches, what a receiver refuses, and how to read a delivery result. Same-session subagent replies stay in `skills/agent-coordination/SKILL.md § Replies from a subagent land in the parent conversation`.

## Cross-session reach & SendMessage authority

`SendMessage` reaches sessions on other machines. `ListAgents` discovers them — labelling disconnected Remote Control rows `offline` and cloud rows `cloud` — and also lists live teammates and the session's own name (the `name` key), the address peers use. `crossSessionInbound` (holds messages into a bypassed-permissions session for approval) and `dialogExpiry` govern inbound traffic; an invalid `crossSessionInbound` value holds messages (user settings) or refuses them (managed settings) rather than being ignored. A message held by the receiving session's own permission-mode policy is not delivered: since 2.1.288 the sender's notice says so and names the holding session, and an SDK sender learns of it mid-turn (earlier builds reported it as delivered). Log it as `result: "blocked"` with `metadata.reason: "held"` (§ Delivery is reported, so check it).

### Restricted sessions & dialog timeout

A `--restricted` session opens no messaging socket (2.1.290), so it is unreachable by design, not gone. A `CLAUDE_CODE_USER_DIALOG_TIMEOUT_MS` value with a unit suffix (`5m`) falls back to `dialogExpiry` instead of reading as milliseconds (2.1.290).

### Sessions without SendMessage & cloud restarts

A session launched without the `SendMessage` tool, as Claude Desktop launches some, is not told to message other sessions, so expect no outbound message from it. A cloud session tells Claude about background agents that finished just before a worker restart, so a completion there survives the restart. After a restart it also names the stopped background agents Claude can resume by id (2.1.292).

### Authority does not relay

Receivers refuse relayed permission requests, and auto mode blocks them outright — across machines as on one. A reattach may nudge a parked agent (re-prompt, supply an awaited answer) but never authorize: permission escalations and the PL gate stay operator-owned.

### Delivery is reported, so check it

A send can come back `refused`, `dropped` (full or rate-limited inbox), `oversized`, `burst_limited`, `queued` or `held` (waiting for a person's approval at the recipient), and `SendMessage`/`ListAgents` say when the session list was too long to enumerate fully — a "peer is gone" conclusion drawn then is unconfirmed, not established. `queued` means the target is an offline Remote Control session on another machine and delivery waits for it to reconnect: never re-send, or the message arrives twice. `held` has the same rule: approval at the named session releases the copy it holds. A subagent or teammate that receives a message mid-run keeps its earlier thinking and prompt cache on resume (2.1.290). Branch on the result per `skills/worktask/references/resume.md § Reattach rows — the SendMessage has a result too`.

### notify_when_idle, availability & preview collapse

`notify_when_idle` on a cross-session `SendMessage` asks a peer for one notice when it next goes idle — opt-in, one-shot, no polling, same-machine peers only (macOS and Linux). Prefer it over a `claude agents --json` poll whenever exactly one peer is awaited.

Cross-session messaging works on every provider and host (Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry, telemetry disabled, Windows, rootless containers), so never gate a handoff, a dispatch flag or a reattach path on provider or OS.

Peer messages collapse to one line — `Message from @<sender>: <first line>` — so a relayed handoff or escalation carries its verdict in the first line. Delivery notices no longer merge two sessions with similar names into one recipient, and an expiry notice no longer blames the desktop app when a terminal session let the message lapse (2.1.292).
