# Request Plan

Produce a **lightweight, grounded plan** from a free-form request plus current repository context,
then hand off to the worktask system. It bridges "I have an idea" and a full worktask: lighter than
a PRD (`/product-requirements`), broader than a sizing estimate (`/estimate`).

The value is being **grounded** — the plan reflects this repo (in-flight work, recent commits,
project memory, relevant code), not a generic template. Read context before planning and let it
change the plan; otherwise this is a wishlist.

## Workflow

### 1. Restate the goal

State the goal in one line, in your own words, so the user can correct a misread cheaply.

#### Ask or plan — decide once, and default to planning

Asking is the exception. The first test — *did the search find the surface?* — is applied in § 2,
where the evidence arrives. What is left here, in order:

1. **No surface at all? Ask — and only ask.** Available once § 2's search has run and found
   nothing. Say so plainly and ask which system is meant. Never produce a full plan for a codebase
   you cannot see: plausible phases for a system nobody can point at read as real work and are not.
2. **Surface found, but two readings of it change the phases? Fold it into the plan.** They
   usually become P0 and P1, or an explicit **Out:** line. Present the plan and name the
   assumption. This branch needs a surface to be ambiguous *about* — reaching it from a request
   whose subject the repo does not contain is how a full plan gets written for a system that
   isn't there.
3. **Genuinely incompatible readings, or no subject named? Ask 1–2 focused questions.**

##### Never both

Never emit both a question and a full plan for one request — pick one. Don't invent scope to fill
silence; a wrong assumption propagates into every later section, but so does a needless question.

### 2. Gather context (lean)

Follow `references/context-gathering.md`. Read only what could change the plan: existing
`.context/` artifacts, project memory, recent git activity, and the code the request touches.

#### Start from what already ships

**Run `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/request-plan/scripts/capability-registry.sh` first, every
time, before any grep.** Not only for "I want X" requests — deciding whether a request is about a capability is itself a guess
made before you know the answer, and the whole list costs about 7k tokens. It is the complete
inventory of this plugin's commands, agents, skills, hooks, skill scripts and harness modules, so it
is not a search and has no stop condition. It is long enough now to be worth reading in one pass
rather than skimming for a keyword: the entry you need is the one whose *description* matches, and
a skim finds only the ones whose path does.

The request words a *need*; the registry words a *domain* — "make the app usable one-handed" will
never share a word with the entry that covers it. Read each description for what the capability
*does*, not for words the request happens to repeat.

##### No worked examples here

Deliberately omitted. Any example concrete enough to be useful is a request someone will later
evaluate this skill against, and printing the answer beside it turns that case into a lookup —
which is exactly how eval cases 73 and 75 were contaminated.

##### The registry precedes the search, never replaces it

**The registry precedes the behaviour search; it never replaces it.** A registry hit tells you which
surface the work belongs to — you still open that surface and read it before planning against it, and
§ "Search by behaviour" below still applies to everything the registry does not list: a skill's
`references/`, the shared canon under `skills/shared/*.md`, and test or eval infrastructure.

##### A hit changes the plan's content, not its obligations

**A registry hit changes the plan's content, not its obligations — with one exception, below.**
Finding an adjacent, partial or underlying capability makes the plan about *using, verifying, or
extending* it. It does not license a short answer: the full template still applies, and the plan
still ends with exactly one `/worktask` line (§ 4). "This already ships, run `/x`" with no trigger is
a failure, not a shortcut — the three ways this goes wrong are ending with a question instead of a
plan, recommending another command *in place of* the handoff, and dropping the trigger because
nothing seems left to do.

##### The one exception: the hit *is* the request

**The exception is § 4's and it is narrow**: only when the request asked to *build* the thing, the
thing already ships as asked, and nothing is left to do. Then the answer says so, cites where, and
stops. It does **not** cover a request to *find*, *use* or *reach* a surface that exists — that is
still a plan, and it is the commonest way this rule gets misread. Nor does it cover a shipped
headline with a live remainder: refute the stale part, plan the rest.

#### Decide which class owns the behaviour

A behaviour in this plugin lives in exactly one of six classes: a **command**, an **agent**, a
**skill**, a **hook**, a skill's **`scripts/`**, or a **harness module**. The registry enumerates all
six, but the classes are the shape of the search even for what it cannot list — a skill's
`references/`, the shared canon, and test or eval infrastructure all sit behind one of the six.

**A search that has not decided which class owns the behaviour has not finished.** Naming the class
is the cheapest way to notice you only looked in one: three of the six are executable and none of
them are found by grepping prose.

#### Search by behaviour, not by filename

Half of all graded failures were one mistake: the search stopped at a file whose *name* fit, in the
first directory that hit, while the file owning the behaviour sat in another subtree. **"Lean"
governs how much you read, never how hard you look.**

- **Use `Explore` for every "where does X live" question** — not a preference. A grep sweep anchored
  on a guessed filename only reproduces the guess.
- **Search for what the code does, not what it would be called.** Grep the symbols, strings, and
  error text the behaviour must produce. A filename is a hypothesis; a matching symbol is evidence.
- **One hit is not a finding.** Continue until a repo-wide search for the behaviour turns up nothing
  further, or until you hold two candidates — then open both and decide which owns it.

#### When you may stop searching

Stop on evidence, not on satisfaction: when you can **name the owning file and say what in it you
read**. "More reading wouldn't change the plan" is not a stop condition — a search that has not
reached the right file cannot tell that from the inside, which is how a confident plan ends up about
the wrong module.

§ 1's "no surface at all" branch is available **only after this search has actually run**.
Asking which system is meant is right when the repo genuinely lacks it, wrong as the exit from a
search that got hard.

#### Confirm ownership before planning against a file

**Confirm the file you found actually owns the behaviour** — open it and check rather than inferring
ownership from a plausible name. A neighbouring file with a similar name is the most common way a
plan ends up specific, confident, and about the wrong thing (a stage-ownership plan that never
opened the stage-ownership doc; a cost-comparison plan that never reached the module producing the
costs). If you cannot confirm ownership, name the file you believe owns it and say you did not verify.

#### Found the surface? Plan it

**The registry or the search located the file, command, hook or mechanism the request is about?
That is enough to plan** — even if a follow-up question also comes to mind. A question you could
have answered by planning costs a round trip and delivers nothing.

This test lives here, not in § 1, because it is decided the moment the evidence arrives. Reaching
§ 1's "ask" branch means this one already answered *no*: the search ran and found nothing.

#### Do not assert what you did not check

**Every negative claim carries its own scope.** "No other path exists", "that mapping is already
complete", or a count of things you did not enumerate are the claims most likely to be wrong and
least likely to be questioned, because they sound like the product of a search.

Make it structural rather than a caution: name the directories you actually enumerated and scope the
sentence to them — "nothing under `tests/`", never "nothing anywhere". **An unscoped negative is a
claim about the whole repo** and needs a whole-repo search behind it; a negative scoped to where you
looked is true and still useful. Whatever the scope does not cover is unverified, so say so.

### 3. Synthesize the plan

Fill the template in `references/plan-template.md` exactly (fixed section order).

#### Key reuse — do not reinvent these

- **Phases** use the P0 Required / P1 Nice-to-have / P2 v1.1 model from
  `skills/shared/three-stage-planning.md`, each independently deliverable. **All three rows always
  appear.** With nothing deferrable, write `P2 — v1.1: none` — dropping the row reads as an
  oversight. Any follow-up you name anywhere in the plan belongs in P1 or P2; naming it and then
  folding it into P0 hides that it is deferrable and collapses a three-phase plan to one.
- **Tests live inside each phase's scope**, never as a separate phase (per the estimation skill).

##### Effort

A T-shirt size plus the 5-factor complexity score (0–25) from
`skills/estimation-methodology/SKILL.md`, as a range — a rough cut, not a budget. **Both parts are
required for every request type**, incidents included: a severity or priority table is not an effort
estimate and does not replace one. Naming the factors behind a surprising score helps, but the size
and the number are what the section owes.

### 4. Recommend the handoff

Follow `references/handoff.md`. Map size + complexity to an invocation with the canonical **Worktask
Tier Selection** logic in `skills/estimation-methodology/SKILL.md`, and emit one ready-to-paste
command line (e.g. `/worktask "<restated goal>"`). The surface check in that section decides
`--secure` and `--emergency` before size is considered.

Recommend the leanest tier the surface check allows: sizing ratchets one way once the worktask
runs, so a stage that finds a surface this plan could not see adds itself back through
`skills/estimation-methodology/SKILL.md § Mid-run re-sizing`, and nothing downgrades.

#### Exactly one `/worktask` line

**Every plan ends with exactly one `/worktask` line.** Naming a more specific command
(`/estimate`) is useful context, never a replacement — recommending one *instead*
of the worktask leaves the user with no handoff. Mention it alongside the trigger, not in place of it.
**Disputing the premise does not suspend the line.** A plan concluding the reported defect is
misdiagnosed, unreproducible, or absent from the file it was blamed on still emits one — triage is
work, and on a present-tense report `--emergency` is the tier that triages it. Prose naming the tier
("route this to incident response") is not the line; the line is a command the user can paste.

"Absent from the file it was blamed on" bounds this to a file that exists whose defect sits
elsewhere. A request whose *subject system* the repo does not contain is § 1's "no surface at
all" branch instead, and § 1 wins: ask, emit no line.

##### One narrow exception: asked to BUILD what already exists, with nothing left

All three must hold: the request asks to **build, add or fix** something; the search shows it
already exists in the form asked for; and **nothing remains to be done**. Then say so, cite where,
and **stop** — no plan template, no trigger. Rendering the sections anyway (a Scope for work that
exists, a P0 reading "run the command") is a build plan wearing a refutation's opening line.

##### Two shapes that resemble that exception and are not it

###### Asked to find, reach or use a capability

"How do I…", "I want X", "where does X live" — the surface existing is the *answer to the
search*, not a reason to withhold the plan. Plan the using,
verifying or extending of what you found, and end with the trigger (§ 2). Stopping at "this already
ships, run `/x`" is the failure § 2 names, not a shortcut it licenses. A found surface makes the
plan shorter and better grounded; it never makes the plan optional.

###### A shipped premise with a live remainder

The headline capability shipped, but the search finds something genuinely still missing or
broken. Refute the stale premise *and* plan the remainder — the
refutation replaces the wrong plan, not the plan. Say plainly which part is stale and which part is
still open, so the user can see you did not simply accept the request as posed.

The test is always whether anything remains to be done. A misdiagnosed bug still needs triage; a
request to *use* a shipped feature still needs a plan; a shipped feature with nothing left does not.

### 5. Output

Print the plan inline; the default is **not** to write files. Offer to persist it to
`.context/request-plan-0.md` (naming per `skills/task-folder-organization/SKILL.md`) when the user
wants it kept or it will directly seed a worktask run.

## What this skill is not

- Not a PRD generator — formal requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria at scale route to
  `/product-requirements`.
- Not a budget/CSV estimator — hours, rates, and exportable sizing route to `/estimate`.
- Not a roadmap — multi-quarter planning belongs in `/roadmap`.

Staying lightweight is the point; resist padding the output toward those heavier formats.
