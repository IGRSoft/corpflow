# Testing Strategy

Canonical testing reference for every platform a worktask routes to. Pyramid, AAA pattern, DV/QA
boundary, and Test Selection Gate are platform-neutral; framework and syntax specifics are gated per
platform in § Framework by platform — an Apple rule never applies off Apple, and vice versa.
Platform→plugin routing: `skills/shared/platform-detection.md`.

## Testing Pyramid

| Layer | Coverage | Scope | When |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| Unit (70%) | Fast, isolated, deterministic | Single logic unit, mocked dependencies | Every commit |
| Integration (20%) | Component interactions | DB/API integration, service-to-service | PR and merge |
| E2E (10%) | Critical user journeys | Real browser/device | Before release |

## Framework by platform

Use the project's established framework — detect it (test layout, manifest dependencies, CI
config) before writing a test. Never add a second framework to a repo that has one; where a repo has
none, pick from the matrix and record the choice in `<plan_file> § test-strategy`.

### Framework matrix — app platforms

| Platform | Unit | Integration | UI / E2E |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|
| `apple` | Swift Testing (`@Suite`/`@Test`/`#expect`) | Swift Testing + in-memory doubles | XCTest / XCUITest |
| `android` | JUnit 5 + MockK, Turbine for flows | JUnit + Robolectric, in-memory Room | Espresso / Compose UI test, Roborazzi screenshots |
| `web` | Vitest or Jest | Testing Library + MSW | Playwright (or Cypress) |

### Framework matrix — systems, backend, ai

| Platform | Unit | Integration | UI / E2E |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|
| `systems` | GoogleTest / Catch2 (C++), Unity / CMocka (C), pytest (Python), bats (Bash) | `ctest` targets driving real I/O | No UI layer — CLI transcripts are the evidence |
| `backend` | Stack-native: Go `testing`+testify, JUnit 5, Vitest/Jest, pytest | Testcontainers for DB/broker/cache | Contract tests (Pact/OpenAPI), k6 for load |
| `ai` | pytest for pipeline and tooling code | pytest + recorded fixtures / VCR | Eval harness (promptfoo, DeepEval, in-repo runner) with scored thresholds |

### Test generation and execution

Per-framework depth lives in the platform plugin (`skills/shared/compatible-plugins.md`), which
exposes `/<plugin>:gen-tests` (write tests in the project's framework) and `/<plugin>:build-test`
(build + run). Prefer delegating execution to `/<plugin>:build-test`: it knows the repo's build
system, and its output is the Build Evidence QA reads.

## AAA Pattern

Three phases in every framework: **Arrange** the inputs and doubles, **Act** once on the unit under
test, **Assert** on the observable result. One logical act per test — a test that acts twice is two
tests. Blank lines, or `// Arrange` / `// Act` / `// Assert` comments in longer tests, keep the
phases legible. Canonical shape (Swift Testing; per-platform variants come from
`/<plugin>:gen-tests`):

```swift
@Suite("Auth Tests")                       // add @MainActor for MainActor-isolated types
struct AuthTests {
    @Test("login with valid credentials succeeds")
    func loginValid() {
        let credentials = Credentials.valid          // Arrange
        let result = authService.login(credentials)  // Act
        #expect(result == .success)                  // Assert
    }
}
```

On Apple, unit tests use Swift Testing; XCTest/XCUITest is reserved for UI tests and is the one place
`test`-prefixed method names are mandatory.

## Test naming conventions

The runner's collection rule wins — it is not a style choice. Where the runner is agnostic,
prefer a sentence naming behavior and expected outcome, not the method called.

### Naming by framework

| Framework | Convention | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Swift Testing | Descriptive func name, **no** `test_` prefix; prose title in `@Test("…")` | `loginValidCredentialsReturnsSession()` |
| XCTest / XCUITest | `test` prefix **required** by the runner | `testLoginFlow()` |
| JUnit 5 (Kotlin/Java) | Backtick sentence (Kotlin) or camelCase + `@DisplayName` | `` `login with valid credentials returns session`() `` |
| Vitest / Jest | `describe` + `it` sentences | `it('returns a session for valid credentials')` |
| pytest | `test_` prefix **required** for collection | `test_login_valid_credentials_returns_session` |
| Go | Exported `Test<Thing>` **required** | `TestLoginValidCredentials` |
| Rust | snake_case `#[test] fn` inside `mod tests` | `fn login_valid_credentials()` |
| bats | `@test "<sentence>"` | `@test "login with valid credentials"` |

## Mutation Testing

A mutation test proves a guard is non-vacuous by breaking what it guards and requiring the guard to
fail; its result carries no information unless the mutation landed. Assert the mutation was applied
before trusting the pass/fail it produced: back the target up, mutate, byte-compare (`diff -q` must
report the files differ), run the test, restore. A silently no-op mutation (a `sed` pattern that
doesn't match, a shifted line number) yields a pass indistinguishable from a weak guard.

## Portable verification greps

A canon-sweep or acceptance-criteria count is evidence only if the command means the same thing on
every host: `grep` may be GNU grep, BSD grep or `ugrep`, which differ in ways that change a count
silently instead of erroring.

- Put `--include=`/`--exclude-dir=` before the pattern, and use `-e` for any pattern containing
  `--` — past a `--` terminator ugrep reads the filter as a filename.
- Never anchor an exclusion regex on a `./` prefix; ugrep omits it, so `^\./…` matches nothing and the
  exclusion silently does not apply.
- Report the per-file decomposition, not only the total — a filter that stopped applying looks
  identical to one that found nothing to exclude.

## DV vs QA Boundary

DV produces the build artifact + Selected Tests list; QA executes the Selected Tests plus visual
checks if gated on, so the DV loop stays fast while QA owns regression coverage.

| DV Stage (Developer) | QA Stage (QA Engineer) |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Unit tests per `<plan_file>` specs | Additional edge case tests |
| Mock implementations for dependencies | Coverage gap analysis |
| Happy path + known error cases | Boundary and stress tests |
| Test data builders/fixtures | Test quality review |
| Build verification + parse markers + emit Selected Tests | Run only the Selected Tests list (plus full suite if `test_mode=full`) |

## Test-Execution Authority

Canonical, single-sourced statement of who may execute tests — orthogonal to `test_mode`
(§ Test Selection Gate), which governs how much runs. Every agent file and skill points here;
none restates the matrix or the runner list below. Authority is a property of the stage, never of
the agent file: a support agent (`designer`, `ethics-reviewer`, `prompt-engineer`,
`workflow-engineer`) inherits the authority of whichever stage it is dispatched into —
`workflow-engineer` acting as DV0 for plugin-infrastructure scope holds DV's authority, not a fixed
authority of its own.

### Definitions

**Test execution** — invoking a runner that evaluates test cases: `bats`, `swift test`, `pytest`,
`python3 -m unittest`, `ctest`, `go test`, `cargo test`, `jest`, `vitest`, `playwright`, `rspec`,
`dotnet test`, `gradle test` / `./gradlew test`, `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn test`, `xcodebuild test`,
`node --test`, `python -m pytest`, `mcp__*__test_*`; plus `./run-tests.sh`, `make test`,
`make coverage`, `make test-ios` in this
repo; plus `/<plugin>:build-test` invoked *without* `--no-test`; plus delegating any of the above
to another agent.

**Build-only verification** — compile, link, type-check, lint, static analysis, and test *collection
without execution* (`bats --count`, `pytest --collect-only`, `--dry-run`). Allowed at every one of
the 13 stages, always — `/<plugin>:build-test --no-test` is the sanctioned delegated form. Only
*reachable* where the stage holds a build path ("Reachable how" below); nominal elsewhere.

### Optional stages and authority

Rows describe a stage's authority *when that stage runs*. AR and TL are optional
(`skills/estimation-methodology/SKILL.md § Stage Inclusion Criteria`); an excluded stage grants its
authority to no one — an excluded AR does not transfer test-architecture authority to DV beyond the
design ownership rule in `agents/developer.md § Architecture Ownership`.

### Authority matrix — DV, QA, AR, DR

| Stage | Build-only | Reachable how | Scoped exec | Full exec | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DV | allowed | own Bash | required | forbidden | full-suite deny is mechanical (`hooks/test-execution-gate.sh`), covering the bare runner and invocations whose flags are all non-selecting; only a genuine selector classifies scoped — § DV full-suite deny |
| QA | allowed | own Bash | allowed | allowed — sole holder | |
| AR | allowed | delegation only (no Bash grant) | forbidden | forbidden | |
| DR | allowed | `/<plugin>:build-test --no-test` | forbidden | forbidden | compile-check carve-out preserved verbatim (`agents/technical-lead.md`) |

#### DV full-suite deny — coverage and known limits

Fail-open by construction: a future unstripped flag degrades to an allow, never to a false deny.

- **Denied** — a bare runner, or an invocation whose arguments are *all* non-selecting. The classifier
  strips each runner's mandatory-but-non-selecting flags first, so configuration buys no escape:
  `xcodebuild test` with `-project`/`-workspace`/`-scheme`/`-destination`/`-sdk`/`-arch`/result-bundle
  and derived-data paths, including quoted multi-word values; `dotnet test <solution|project>`;
  `gradle test -p .` (task found order-independently); `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn test` with
  `--ci`/`--watch`/`--silent`/bare `--`; `cargo test --release`.
- **Scoped** — a genuine selector: `-only-testing:`, `--filter`, `-k`, `-t`, `-run`, or a real
  positional (`cargo test --release foo`); see `skills/shared/test-selection-syntax.md`. `-c` is a
  build-only carve-out for `bats` (`--count`), `go test` (compile-only) and `rspec` (`--colour`).

##### The Node runner

`node` is a runner only with `--test`. A bare `node <script>` is script execution and classifies
as not a test run, the same discrimination `gradle`/`./gradlew` get from their task name — without it
every `node` invocation in a Node project would deny at a banned stage. `--test-reporter` and
`--test-concurrency` are configuration, not selection; `--test-name-pattern` and `--test-only` are
genuine selectors and classify scoped.

##### Known limits

- **Whole-tree positionals** — `go test ./...` and `pytest tests/` are allowed at DV though they are
  full runs. Deliberate policy limit: flipping the positional limb's polarity changes the fail
  direction.
- **Package-manager `-c` residual** — `npm test -- -c <spec>` is genuinely scoped and denies anyway
  (`pnpm`/`yarn` share the arm), because treating `-c` as valueless would let full runs classify
  scoped. Package managers hide the runner, so the ambiguity is irreducible; `npm test -- <spec>` is
  unaffected, and the human-only `CORPFLOW_TEST_GATE=off` covers the rest.

### Authority matrix — all other stages

| Stage | Build-only | Reachable how | Scoped exec | Full exec | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SR | allowed | narrowed Bash, read-only introspection (git/jq/cat/head/tail) | forbidden | forbidden | no `Skill` tool → `build-test --no-test` nominal, not reachable; scan capability is delegation-dependent (§ Mechanical enforcement) |
| RE | allowed | same narrowed Bash as SR | forbidden | forbidden | same `Skill`-tool gap as SR |
| IR | allowed | broad Bash (documented carve-out) | forbidden | forbidden | incident reproduction is not test execution (§ Escalation path) |
| PL, TL, DC, FN, ST | allowed | delegation only (no test-capable Bash) | forbidden | forbidden | nominal allowance |
| Support (`designer`, `ethics-reviewer`, `prompt-engineer`, `workflow-engineer`) | allowed | per agent | inherits dispatched stage | inherits dispatched stage | authority follows the stage acted for, not the agent name |

### Auto-promotion note

DV's no-handler auto-promotion never widens to `full` (`test-selection-syntax.md § Auto-promotion
when no handler`): the cap is `module-scope`, an execution-only value recorded in
the DV artifact's `§ Decisions`, never a `test_mode` value — that vocabulary stays exactly
`build-only | scoped | full`, unchanged and PL0-owned.

### Dispatch discipline — the brief carries the invocation

A stage brief's test invocation comes from `<plan_file>` frontmatter (`test_mode`,
`always_required_tests`) — never from a runner command pasted out of the repo's `CLAUDE.md` / README
"core commands" section: those are full-suite-shaped by design and carry no selector, so a DV brief
built from one makes DV pre-empt the regression gate QA exists to hold.

Every DV/QA brief therefore states the resolved mode and the exact selector it implies
(`-only-testing:…`, `--tests …`, a pytest nodeid — grammar in
`skills/shared/test-selection-syntax.md`). Where `always_required_tests` is spelled in a different
grammar than the platform's selector syntax, DV reconciles the two and records the resolved spelling
in its artifact's `§ Decisions`.

### Escalation path

A banned stage that believes runtime evidence is needed never self-serves. Ordered:

1. Non-blocking need — record `requests_test_evidence: <what and why>` in the stage's own artifact
   (`§ Findings` / `§ Notes`); QA ingests and executes it like its own additions
   (`agents/qa-engineer.md § Q1 QA Additions`).
2. Blocking need — return `verdict: blocked` with `error_escalated_to: "DV"`; the orchestrator
   re-opens DV through the existing error-handling loop (`skills/agent-coordination/SKILL.md § Error
   Handling`). No new machinery.
3. Incident reproduction is not test execution — running the app, a repro script, or hitting a
   failing endpoint is allowed for IR; its fix verification still routes through the emergency
   pipeline's own DV and QA stages.
4. Compile-only checks are unaffected — `/<plugin>:build-test --no-test` stays available to every
   stage regardless of authority.

### Mechanical enforcement

Three layers, cheapest first (`skills/worktask/SKILL.md` step 4.8b,
`hooks/test-execution-gate.sh`):

1. Tool-grant narrowing — `security-reviewer` and `release-engineer` drop bare `Bash` for scoped
   allow-lists (the `technical-lead`/`project-manager` idiom); `incident-responder`, `prompt-engineer`
   and `workflow-engineer` keep broad Bash as documented carve-outs.
2. Orchestrator step 4.8b — a NO-TEST-EXECUTION banner + `stage_test_ban_enforced` audit row in
   the composed prompt of every dispatched stage not in `{DV, QA}`.
3. The `PreToolUse` hook — `hooks/test-execution-gate.sh`, fail-open on ambiguity, resolves the
   acting stage from `.context/state.json` (never agent/payload identity) and denies test-runner
   invocations outside `{DV, QA}`, plus DV full-suite runs. Exit code is always 0; the decision
   travels in `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`. Only this layer covers delegated calls and the
   orchestrator's own shell.

### Redundant-run suppression

Authority answers *who*; this answers *again?*. Once a stage holding authority has been allowed a test
invocation, the same invocation is denied while the tree is byte-identical — it can only reproduce the
result already on record. Scope is `run_index`, so a run recorded by one stage covers a later stage's
identical run within the same run. Denied callers are told to cite the prior run: its stage and
timestamp appear in the deny reason and in a `test_execution_deduped` audit row. Build-only
verification is never suppressed.

#### A prior that executed nothing suppresses nothing

Suppression only makes sense against a result that could be cited instead. A prior whose evidence
token is `tests:0`, `discovered:<n>` (the runner enumerated cases and executed none), `unrecorded`
(a marker predating the evidence grammar), or any shape this grammar does not cover records no
result, so the gate allows and writes a `test_dedupe_skipped_zero_prior` row instead of a denial —
denying would refuse the only run that could still produce evidence.

#### Keyed on the tree, never on an outcome

`PreToolUse` cannot know whether a run passed, so the key is the tree: HEAD plus
`git status --porcelain` and `git diff HEAD`, the diff being load-bearing because porcelain
reports only names and status letters. Any edit to tracked content changes the fingerprint and
re-enables the command with no flag — this is what keeps test → fix → retest working, and it is the
property to protect in any change to the fingerprint.

The one gap, documented rather than closed: an untracked file's *content* is outside
the digest. Its creation shows in porcelain, so the first write moves the fingerprint; later edits
to a file never `git add`ed do not. Staged content is inside the digest — `git diff HEAD` covers the
index — so staging is not a way to re-enable a run, and neither is committing anything less than a
real change.

#### Fail-open and the hatch

Every unresolvable input — no git, no `shasum`, no `run_index` on the ledger — skips suppression and
allows, matching the hook's fail-open contract. `CORPFLOW_TEST_DEDUPE=off` in the process environment
disables it for flake investigation; like `CORPFLOW_TEST_GATE=off` it is a human ask, not
agent-serviceable, and is noted once per `.context/` in the audit trail. The gate keeps its own
sentinels under `.context/logs/.test-runs/` and does not read `full_test_run`/`scoped_test_run`
audit rows, which `skills/agent-coordination/SKILL.md` binds as audit-only, never a gate.

### SR/RE control layering

For SR and RE specifically, the hook is not a backstop behind the grant narrowing — it is the only
control. Their platform-auditor delegates (e.g. `Task(system-developer:sys-security-auditor)`) hold
test-capable Bash grants of their own (`ctest`, `make`, …) that narrowing SR's/RE's own grant does not
touch; the hook denies the delegate's leaf call via the same state.json stage resolution. Correct by
design — but it means a regression in stage resolution is a complete loss of enforcement for SR/RE,
not a degradation of a defense-in-depth layer.

### Escape-hatch honesty

`CORPFLOW_TEST_GATE=off` and `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (pointed at a directory with no
`.context/state.json`) are both agent-writable across sessions, not agent-proof: any stage holding
`Write`/`Edit` can write `.claude/settings.json` `env`, effective on the next session or resume.
Within a live session neither is reachable from a command string — the hook reads process env, not
payload text — which is what makes the hatch a human relief valve rather than an agent-serviceable
retry. Across sessions it is human-intent-scoped, not a hard boundary; layers 1 and 2 do not share
this property. The hook logs a `test_gate_disabled` audit row the first time either vector is seen
disabled per `.context/`, so the disable is reviewable rather than silent.

## Test Selection Gate

Tests are slow (especially UI/simulator bundles). The gate decides, per worktask run, how much of
the test pyramid runs and where, so backend, refactor, and doc-only tasks do not pay
simulator-startup cost.

### Three test modes

| Mode | DV behaviour | QA behaviour | When PL sets it |
|------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `build-only` | Build; run no tests (`Executed at DV` empty), except the no-handler promotion in § Auto-promotion safety nets. Parse `@depends-on:` markers. Emit Selected Tests list for QA. | Run only Selected Tests (always-required ∪ dependency-matched). Visual comparison gated on `ui_visual_check`. | Opt-in via explicit `test_mode: build-only`, in repos that completed marker migration: refactors without behavior change, dep updates, doc-only and internal-tool changes. |

#### `scoped` and `full` modes

| Mode | DV behaviour | QA behaviour | When PL sets it |
|------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `scoped` (effective default) | Build + run Selected Tests + tests in any module the diff touches. | Selected Tests + module-level tests + any QA-added edge-case tests. Visual comparison gated on `ui_visual_check`. | Bug fixes, features not spanning subsystems, diffs touching files with weak `@depends-on:` coverage (defensive). Default when `test_mode` is omitted (avoids silent coverage blackout on untagged repos). |
| `full` | Build + run Selected Tests at DV. | Full project test suite as regression gate. Visual comparison gated on `ui_visual_check`. | Release candidates (RE prep), multi-module features (auth touching networking + UI + persistence), first run after a major dependency upgrade, stakeholder-requested regression. |

#### Effective default

Omitting `metadata.test_mode` resolves to `scoped`, not `build-only` — preserving "DV runs scoped
tests, QA runs the unit+integration suite" for untagged repositories. The `build-only` speedup
requires writing `test_mode: build-only` explicitly and meaningful marker coverage (the parser
warns if `< 50%` of test files lack any marker).

#### Comment/doc-only diffs — PL *selects* `build-only`

When every hunk of the planned diff is a comment, a prose file (`docs/`, `*.md`), or a non-executable
string, no test outcome can change: PL sets `test_mode: build-only` and says why in
`<plan_file> § test-strategy`. The one case where the marker-coverage precondition does not apply —
the mode is chosen because nothing executable changed, not because markers stand in for a run. One
executable hunk anywhere in the planned diff disqualifies it.

Downstream: a doc-only change landing after QA (typically DC, which holds no execution authority)
does not re-trigger QA. FN commits on QA's existing evidence and records the post-QA diff as doc-only
in `complete-summary-N.md`.

#### Auto-promotion safety nets

DV/QA enforce these even if PL set a tighter mode:

- Selected Tests empty AND `test_mode = build-only` → DV warns and still runs no tests; QA promotes to
  `scoped` with a logged note in `testing-N.md § Notes`.
- No wired marker-parser handler for the platform (every platform except Apple today —
  `test-selection-syntax.md § Identifier grammar by platform`) AND `test_mode ∈ {build-only, scoped}`
  → DV auto-promotes to module-scope (never `full` — § Test-Execution Authority) with a logged
  warning. Metadata keeps the PL-declared mode; the promotion is recorded in
  the DV artifact's `§ Decisions` as `auto_promoted_mode: module-scope`. If module scope cannot be
  computed, DV runs the smoke set instead and records `deferred_to_qa: full_regression` — it does not
  widen further.

### Contract

- **Flag**: `metadata.test_mode: build-only | scoped | full` in `<plan_file>` frontmatter; absent →
  `scoped` (see *Effective default*), `build-only` is opt-in.
- **Companion flags**:
  - `metadata.always_required_tests: [<test ID>...]` — explicit override, included in every Selected
    Tests list regardless of mode.
  - `metadata.ui_visual_check: <bool>` — default `false`. When `true` AND `.context/designs/` exists,
    QA performs Design Comparison. Independent of `test_mode`.
- **Writer**: PL stage (`skills/worktask/references/pl0-procedure.md § Test Strategy Definition`).

#### Readers

- DV step D2 (`agents/developer.md`) — parses markers, computes Selected Tests, runs `Executed Tests
  (DV)` only when `test_mode ∈ {scoped, full}`; under `build-only` it runs tests only through the
  no-handler promotion (§ Auto-promotion safety nets). The mode is D2's rule, not a gate:
  `hooks/test-execution-gate.sh` never reads `test_mode` and allows DV a selector-bearing run in
  every mode.
- QA step Q1 (`agents/qa-engineer.md`) — three-mode dispatcher.
- QA Design Comparison (`agents/qa-engineer.md § Design Comparison`) — gated on `ui_visual_check=true`
  (not `test_mode`).
- DR (`agents/technical-lead.md`) does not run tests, so the gate does not apply; needing runtime
  verification it records `requests_test_evidence:` for QA and never executes (authority is canonical
  in § Test-Execution Authority).

### DV Executed vs Selected (scope split)

DV's `Selected Tests` is the handoff artifact consumed by QA; `Executed Tests (DV)` is the
subset DV actually runs.

- Selected Tests = full algorithm output (smoke ∪ dependency-matched ∪ covers-changed-files ∪
  module-level ∪ `metadata.always_required_tests`). Always written to
  `§ Selected Tests` in each DV row's artifact. QA executes the union across every DV artifact
  (`refs.dev[]`).
- Executed Tests (DV) = (Selected ∩ test files Added/Modified in
  `git diff --diff-filter=AMR <base>...HEAD`) ∪ `metadata.always_required_tests`. Only this subset
  runs at DV.

#### Empty-set safety net and rationale

If Executed Tests (DV) is empty AND Selected Tests is non-empty (production changed without touching
tests), DV runs only the smoke set and records `auto_executed: smoke_set` in `§ Decisions`; QA still
executes the full Selected list. Rationale: DV verifies that the code+tests it just wrote compile and
pass, while broader regression (dep-matched, covers, module-level) belongs to QA so DV stays fast and
QA owns the gate. Canonical derivation: `agents/developer.md § D2`.

### `ui_visual_check`

Set `true` when at least one applies: new user-facing views or screens (SwiftUI/UIKit, Compose,
React/Vue/Svelte/Angular components); design artifacts in `.context/designs/` need verification;
layout/styling/animation changes require screen capture; stakeholder requests UI verification.
Independent of `test_mode` — a `build-only` plan can still set it `true` for a purely visual diff
(rare but legal).

### Selected Tests — production by DV

DV's D2 step parses test sources for the markers in `skills/shared/test-selection-syntax.md` and
produces, as an H3 under `## tests-added` in `development-N.md`:

```markdown
### Selected Tests

| Mode | build-only |
| Reason | metadata.test_mode default |

#### Always Required
- AppLaunchTests.testLaunchSucceeds — `@test-required`
- AuthSmokeTests.testLoginRoundtrip — `metadata.always_required_tests`

#### Dependency-Matched
| Test | Matched on | Source |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ |
| PaymentRefundTests.testRefundFlow | `PaymentService` (changed in `PaymentService.swift:42`) | `// @depends-on: PaymentService` at `PaymentRefundTests.swift:8` |

#### Excluded (with reason)
| Test | Reason |
| ---- | ------ |
| OrderHistoryTests.testListRender | No marker matches diff; `test_mode != full` |
```

QA reads this section verbatim; QA's edge-case additions go to an
`### Selected Tests (QA additions)` H3 under `## results` in `testing-N.md`.

### Design↔result image comparison (wired flow)

With the Design Comparison gate open (`ui_visual_check: true` AND `.context/designs/` artifacts
present), QA's primary comparison reuses DV-captured result images and runs an objective RMSE
pixel-diff pre-pass before multimodal vision, rather than always re-capturing live. The per-row
algorithm and the reporting `RMSE` column are canonical in
`skills/worktask/references/visual-qa.md`; the gate is `agents/qa-engineer.md § Design Comparison`.

#### Join key (Option A)

DV's per-task `.context/images/<worktask_id>/screenshots-<TASK_ID>.md` manifests carry an optional
trailing `Design Ref` column populated with the matching `figma-registry.md` row `ID`
(`skills/dv-screenshot-capture/SKILL.md § Registry tagging`). QA joins
`screenshots-*.md.Design Ref → figma-registry.md.ID` by ID equality; the mapped DV image is both the
RMSE `--candidate` (`skills/dv-screenshot-capture/scripts/visual-diff.sh`) and the vision input. Live
re-capture is the fallback only — used when no DV image maps.

#### Verdict reconciliation and degradation (by reference)

- RMSE is a one-way escalator: it may raise severity, never lower it (RMSE is blind to
  copy/semantic errors). Full 6-row matrix:
  `skills/worktask/references/visual-qa.md § Verdict reconciliation`.
- The reuse is strictly additive; the full invariant list (gate unchanged, absent DV images →
  live-capture, `magick` absent → vision-only non-blocking, no registry → Glob Discovery, manifest
  without a `Design Ref` column) is canonical in
  `skills/worktask/references/visual-qa.md § Degradation invariants`.

### Skip mechanics — positive selection everywhere

Every platform translates the Selected Tests list into positive include flags, never negative
excludes: an exclude list silently grows stale as tests are added, an include list fails loudly.
Per-platform flag syntax and identifier grammar are canonical in
`test-selection-syntax.md § Platform handlers` — not restated here. Drop the filter entirely for
`test_mode=full`; the full suite is the regression gate. Prefer `/<plugin>:build-test`, which applies
the correct form for the repo.

### Skip mechanics — Apple platforms

Selected Tests become positive `-only-testing:` arguments (one per owning suite, deduplicated), never
`-skip-testing:`:

```bash
# Selected Tests = [PaymentRefundTests.testRefundFlow, AppLaunchTests.testLaunchSucceeds]
# → flags collapse to the owning suite (suite-terminal); never per-function
xcodebuild test -project MyApp.xcodeproj -scheme MyApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
  -only-testing:MyAppTests/PaymentRefundTests \
  -only-testing:MyAppTests/AppLaunchTests
```

Identifiers are suite-terminal (`<Target>/<Suite>`) per `test-selection-syntax.md § Apple
identifier grammar — suite-terminal`; a per-function segment selects nothing under Swift Testing.
Under `test_mode=full` the whole suite runs without `-only-testing:`, and UI bundles run unless
explicitly excluded (no implicit `-skip-testing:`).

### Recording the resolved selection

DV records `test_mode`, `selected_tests_count`, and `ui_visual_check` in
its artifact's `§ Decisions` (the row's `metadata.artifact`). QA records the resolved mode and any
`Selected Tests (QA additions)` in `testing-N.md § Notes`. Applies on every platform, including runs
auto-promoted to `module-scope` (§ Test-Execution Authority).

### Marker and footer grammar

Full marker grammar (`@test-required`, `@depends-on:`, `@test-tag:`), parser pseudocode, and Swift
Testing trait equivalents: `skills/shared/test-selection-syntax.md`.

Source files also carry a `Test Info` footer (`@test-file:`, `@related-tests:`, `@test-coverage:`) and
test files a `Source Info` footer (`@source-file:`, `@doc-refs:`). Sentinel words are fixed; the
comment decoration around them is language-native (`// MARK: -` on Swift, `# region` on Python, a
plain banner elsewhere). Advisory — they do not affect selection — but they let reviewers and tooling
verify coverage intent bidirectionally. Grammar, platform variants, examples:
`test-selection-syntax.md § Footer Markers`.
