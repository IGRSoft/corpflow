#!/usr/bin/env bash
# @description branch-name.sh — the PL-stage branch-naming entry point. Renames the
#   current branch onto `<type>/[<ticket>-]<slug>` (see git-conventions.md § Branch
#   Naming), once, at the very start of the planning stage, before any commit exists.
#
#   Sources branch-lib.sh from its own directory for the guard ladder, the type
#   vocabulary, goal resolution, and the audit/scope helpers. The ticket segment is
#   derived from the goal text only — no issue lookup — and this script never writes
#   state.json: it prints `target_branch=<name>` then `branch=<name>` and the
#   orchestrator stamps `facts.branch` through the normal state-patch path.
#
#   Two names, two decisions. `branch=` is the LOCAL branch as it stands after this
#   run (the final stdout line — every consumer parses that one). `target_branch=` is
#   the name the REMOTE branch should carry, derived on every arm that can derive one
#   even when the local rename did not happen: an upstream or an existing target blocks
#   the local rename without making the PR head any less wrong. The orchestrator stamps
#   `facts.branch` from `target_branch=` when `branch=` is empty or non-conventional
#   (`commands/worktask.md § Step 3c`).
#
#   Inside a linked worktree the naming step RENAMES the local branch, like any other
#   checkout, so `branch=` and `target_branch=` agree. The host's branch↔workspace mapping
#   is updated by that rename — deliberately: a host-assigned placeholder is not a name
#   worth preserving, and a host may rename the branch again mid-run without telling the
#   pipeline. Set `BRANCH_NAME_WORKTREE_RENAME=0` to restore the previous defer-to-host
#   behaviour, in which the local name is kept and only `target_branch=` is derived.
#
#   Every rename-mode outcome exits 0, including an unreachable library: a naming
#   problem must never stop a worktask from planning. `--check`/`--print-types`/
#   `--print-target` are query modes with no git mutation and no audit row.
#
# @arg --goal <text>      Explicit goal text (Q1). Ranked fallbacks:
#                          argument > state.json .facts.goal > .worktask_id.
# @arg --state <path>     state.json path (default: .context/state.json).
# @arg --context <dir>    .context dir (default: .context).
# @arg --check <name>     Query: is <name> conventional? No git, no state, no audit row.
# @arg --print-types      Query: the type vocabulary, one token per line.
# @arg --print-target     Query: the target derived from --goal, bare, on stdout. Composes
#                         with --goal. Runs NO git command, walks no guard ladder, writes
#                         no state and no audit row — unlike BRANCH_NAME_PRINT, which is
#                         evaluated after the ladder and so answers "what would the rename
#                         do", not "what does this text derive to".
# @arg -h | --help        Show this header.
#
# @env BRANCH_NAME_PRINT  1 => dry run: print the bare target, rename nothing, no
#                         audit row, no `branch=`/`target_branch=` lines. A truncated
#                         slug is reported on stderr only. Evaluated AFTER the guard
#                         ladder so a dry run can never bypass a guard.
# @env BRANCH_NAME_WORKTREE_RENAME
#                         Literal `0` => inside a linked worktree, keep the host's local
#                         name and derive `target_branch=` only (the pre-R6 behaviour).
#                         Unset or any other value => rename, like any other checkout.
#                         Subtractive only: it can turn a would-be rename into a no-op and
#                         can never authorize one a higher guard refused.
# @env MILESTONE_MODE     1 => batch routing; self-disables.
# @env INCIDENT_MODE      1 => incident routing; self-disables.
# @env WORKSPACE_ROOT     Read transitively by fn_batch_scope / resolve_base_ref.
# @env FN_BASE_REF        Highest-priority integration-branch override (unrenamed
#                         despite the prefix — see handoff-protocol.md § metadata.base_ref).
#
# @exitcode 0   Every rename-mode outcome (ok, noop, failed, skipped, unreachable
#               library). `--print-target`: a conventional target was printed.
# @exitcode 1   `--check`: name is not conventional. `--print-target`: unresolvable
#               (empty goal, empty slug, or a non-conventional candidate) — no stdout.
