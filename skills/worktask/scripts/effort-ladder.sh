# @description effort-ladder.sh — the effort tier ladder and the resolver's tier/model clamp,
#   shared verbatim by everything that computes a bumped effort: the orchestrator's Step C.0a
#   resolver dispatch, state-patch.sh (the `metadata.effort` enum gate) and their bats suites.
#
#   One definition, several consumers, for the same reason as sweep-stub-lib.sh: a tier that
#   one caller accepts and another rejects is the class of disagreement this file exists to
#   make impossible. The ladder itself is canonical in
#   `skills/shared/model-selection.md § Effort Levels`; this file is its executable copy and
#   the bats suite asserts the two agree.
#
#   Sources nothing, sets no options, does no work at load.
#
#   Symbols: EFFORT_ENUM, EFFORT_NON_OPUS_CEILING, EFFORT_OPUS_FAMILY_RE,
#            effort_rank, effort_plus_one, effort_for_resolver.
#
# Minimum shell: bash 3.2+ (macOS default) — no associative arrays, no `local -n`.

# Constants are read by the sourcing consumers, never inside this file.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034

# Anti-execution guard — MUST be the first statement.

# Not `readonly`: the bats suites source this file more than once per process, and a second

# and the rank walk below all derive from one string.
EFFORT_ENUM='low medium high xhigh max'

# `xhigh` requires Opus 5 or Fable 5; Sonnet silently downgrades the thinking budget rather
# than failing (`model-selection.md § xhigh routing`). A resolver that asked for a tier the
# model cannot carry would run one or two rungs below what the audit row claims, so the bump
# stops here on everything else. Ceiling, not a rejection: the resolver still runs.
EFFORT_NON_OPUS_CEILING='high'

# Alias-level test, matching what `metadata.model` actually carries. `model-selection.md
# § Prefer the alias over a pinned id` makes the alias the only value the pipeline writes, so
# matching ids here would encode a form no stage emits. A full id that slipped through is
# treated as non-Opus — the safe direction, since the clamp only ever lowers.
EFFORT_OPUS_FAMILY_RE='^(opus|fable)$'

# Splits EFFORT_ENUM into _el_arr under a KNOWN IFS. Every consumer sets its own IFS —
# state-patch.sh runs under `IFS=$'\n\t'` — and a bare `for t in $EFFORT_ENUM` there yields
# the whole enum as ONE word, so every lookup fails and every effort reads as off-ladder.
# `IFS=' ' read` scopes the override to the builtin instead of mutating the caller's shell.
