# portability-lint.sh — flags BSD/GNU shell divergences (rules P001-P008) so a new one
# cannot land the way the 32 mktemp -t sites did.
#
# Usage:
#   portability-lint.sh                 # repo subject: git ls-files '*.sh' '*.bats' 'Makefile'
#   portability-lint.sh [--] <path>...  # explicit paths
#   portability-lint.sh --self-test     # built-in fixtures, one positive + one negative per rule
#   portability-lint.sh -h | --help
#
# Rules (IDs are interface — they appear in output and in disable directives):
#   P001  mktemp with -t in any option position (BSD "-t" means prefix, not GNU's template)
#   P002  mktemp template whose XXXXXX run is not the final characters (BSD substitutes
#         only a trailing run; a suffix after it comes back literal)
#   P003  sed -i with no suffix argument (BSD requires one, even if empty)
#   P004  single-path stat/date/hash with no sibling form in the same file
#   P005  bash 4+ syntax against the repository's bash 3.2 floor
#   P006  unguarded platform-only (Apple) binary at command position
#   P007  direct `uname` call outside host-os-lib.sh
#   P008  GNU-only flags (grep -P, find -printf, sort -V, readlink -f, GNU long options)
#
# Suppression, in precedence order:
#   1. A line whose first non-blank character is `#` is never scanned.
#   2. Inline: `# portability-lint disable=P001 — <reason>`, same line or the line above.
#      The reason is mandatory; a reasonless directive is itself reported as P000.
#   3. File-level: `# portability-lint disable-file=P004,P008 — <reason>` in the first 20 lines.
#   4. Hard path exclusions: tests/vendor/ and this lint's own fixture directory.
#
# A hit prints `<path>:<line>:<RULE-ID>: <message>` on stdout; error lines start
# `portability-lint: ` on stderr, with one count line at the end.
#
# Exit: 0 clean, 1 at least one violation, 2 usage error / unreadable path / not a git
# repository / self-test harness unreachable. 2 wins over 1 — a partial scan is no verdict.
#
# Minimum shell: bash 3.2+ (macOS default).
