# @description state-patch.sh — synchronous Step-6.5 state.json completion patch.
#
#   Resolves the artifact path for a stage, parses its `handoff:` frontmatter,
#   builds the completion patch, and performs an atomic tmp → fsync → rename
#   merge into .context/state.json.  Includes the ENOSPC / DISK_MIN_GB guard
#   (< DISK_MIN_GB halts; < DISK_WARN_GB warns) so callers share one policy.
#
#   This is the SINGLE IMPLEMENTATION of the state-patch logic.  The
#   SubagentStop hook at hooks/state-merge.sh delegates to this script
#   via `bash <path>/state-patch.sh [opts]` — no merge logic lives in the hook
#   itself beyond the delegation call.
#
# @arg --stage <CODE>       Stage code (PL AR TL DV DR SR QA DC RE FN ST IR ET).
#                           Required unless --artifact is given with parseable frontmatter.
# @arg --artifact <path>    Explicit artifact path.  When omitted, resolved from
#                           --stage + run_index from state.json.
# @arg --prev <CODE>        Previous stage code, or USER for the documented USER→PL /
#                           USER→IR origin edges.  When present, ALSO writes
#                           handoffs["<PREV>→<TASK_ID>"] = "<summary> ref:<artifact basename>"
#                           from the parsed frontmatter summary — the ledger edge every stage
#                           agent would otherwise hand-roll in inline jq.  ABSENT = ledger
#                           patch only, byte-stable; hook callers
#                           never pass it, so the SubagentStop path is untouched.
#                           USER is predecessor-only: it never resolves an artifact and is
#                           NOT a valid --stage.
# @arg --state <path>       state.json path (default: .context/state.json).
# @arg --log <path>         Append log to this file (default: .context/logs/state-merge.log).
# @arg --disk-check [root]  Run the ENOSPC guard before writing.  Optional filesystem-root
#                           value (defaults to "."); a following token that begins with "-"
#                           is NOT consumed as the root.  When the guard fires (halt), exits 2;
#                           on warn exits 0.
# @arg --via <hook|step6_5> Stamp tasks.<ID>.completed_via with the enforcement
#                           layer that fired.  Omit for agent self-patch (Layer 1);
#                           F3 stamps "f3" via its own patch.  Absence encodes Layer 1.
# @arg --task-id <ID>       Explicit ledger key (e.g. DV1).  When omitted the id is resolved
#                           from the stage code: the instance whose recorded (else planned)
#                           artifact matches --artifact, else the open instance of a split
#                           stage, else the highest existing, else <CODE>0.  Two open
#                           instances of one stage with nothing to disambiguate them exit 4
#                           before any write.
# @arg --allow-missing-artifact
#                           Suppress the exit-3 assertion and restore the exit-0 no-op for a
#                           caller that knows the artifact is absent.  It does NOT patch:
#                           with no artifact there is no frontmatter to build a patch from,
#                           so NEITHER the stage entry NOR the handoff edge is written.
#                           To record a stage whose artifact does not exist, write
#                           state.json directly (handoff-protocol.md#layer-1-fallback).
# @arg --facts <json>       Union-merge compressed facts into facts.*.  Object keyed by any
#                           subset of decisions | open_questions | files_modified |
#                           tests_added | branch | stream_branches.  COMPOSES with --stage: applied after the
#                           artifact/verdict preflight, in its own atomic window, so one call
#                           patches both the ledger row and the facts a stage recorded.  A
#                           refused or skipped stage patch (unresolved artifact, unparsed
#                           stage, missing state.json, or a refused verdict) drops the paired
#                           --facts payload too; standalone it exits 0 after the merge.
#                           Union, never replace — identity rule at § Facts union below.
#                           open_questions items must be FULL sweep stubs (string .id, .class
#                           and .ref, boolean .blocks_next_stage); a partial one exits 2 with
#                           state.json untouched.  branch is a string matching
#                           ^[A-Za-z0-9._/][A-Za-z0-9._/-]{0,199}$, stored at facts.branch
#                           (last writer wins, exempt from the array-shape check); any other
#                           shape is a whole-payload refusal, exit 2. A branch-only payload
#                           counts as non-empty (no facts-empty no-op).
#                           stream_branches is an object <stream> -> <branch>: key matching
#                           ^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$ (<=40 chars), value matching the branch
#                           regex; unioned by key into facts.stream_branches (a later write
#                           replaces only its own streams), facts.branch untouched. Any bad
#                           entry is a whole-payload refusal, exit 2; {} is a no-op.
#
#   Ledger ops — direct tasks{} writes.  Each short-circuits the artifact path and exits.
#   --task-create is the ONLY op that may introduce a key; the rest reject an unknown ID
#   rather than autovivifying a task nobody seeded.
#
# @arg --task-create  <ID> --metadata <json>  Seed tasks.<ID> as pending; no-op if it exists.
#                                             --metadata is optional (defaults to {}).
# @arg --task-status  <ID> <status>           pending|in_progress|completed|blocked|skipped|failed|stale.
#                                             `stale` parks a task whose consumed input was
#                                             corrected: it is neither ready (the loop's filter
#                                             takes `pending` only) nor settled, so tasks blocked
#                                             by it stay unready until something settles it. It
#                                             names a ledger status ONLY — unrelated to the
#                                             liveness sense of "stale" in stale-check.sh and to
#                                             the `stale_dependents` field of the replay survey.
# @arg --task-block   <ID> --on  <ID[,ID...]> Union into blocked_by[].
# @arg --task-unblock <ID> --off <ID[,ID...]> Subtract from blocked_by[].
# @arg --task-meta    <ID> --set <json>       Merge into tasks.<ID>.metadata.
#                                             --raise-only: drop `model`/`effort` from the
#                                             merge when it would lower the row's CURRENT
#                                             value (ladder rank; opus>sonnet>haiku) — every
#                                             other key still applies. Opt-in; unset means the
#                                             legacy unconditional merge.
# @arg --ledger-meta  --set <json>            Merge into the ledger's TOP-LEVEL metadata{}.
#                                             The only op that writes outside tasks{} and
#                                             facts{}: base_ref, milestone and the other
#                                             run-wide keys readers resolve from there had
#                                             no scripted writer, so they were hand-edited
#                                             into state.json around this script.
# @arg --resolve-models [--corpflow <path>]   Stamp state.models{<agent>: {model,effort,source}}
#                                             for every agents/*.md row, merging a project-root
#                                             CORPFLOW.md `## Models` override (default lookup:
#                                             ${CONTEXT_DIR%/.context}/CORPFLOW.md) row by row,
#                                             fail-open, over the built-in matrix
#                                             (skills/shared/stage-codes.md § Agent Model
#                                             Matrix). Resolved once; --task-create reads the
#                                             result. Idempotent overwrite, not a merge.
# @arg --task-replay  <ID> [--cascade]        Reset one settled/failed task to pending so the
#                                             stage loop dispatches it again.  Clears
#                                             metadata.retry_count, metadata.error_escalated_to
#                                             and completed_via; artifact, verdict, worktree and
#                                             handoffs survive (the completion merge rewrites
#                                             them together).  Every guard runs BEFORE any
#                                             mutation, so a refusal leaves state.json
#                                             byte-identical.  --cascade also resets the
#                                             transitive dependents reachable through
#                                             blocked_by, skipping FN/RE with a warning.
#                                             A reset row holding tests_executed also gets
#                                             rework_pending: true, so its next completion
#                                             merge files the prior list under rework_runs[]
#                                             as a new round instead of overwriting it.
# @arg --agents-json <path>                   Passed through to stale-check.sh for the replay
#                                             liveness guard.  Test/diagnostic seam only.
# @arg --task-reopen <TARGET> --from <SOURCE> [--finding-file <path|->]
#                                             Re-open a task a correction names.  Guards run
#                                             BEFORE any mutation — target exists, target is
#                                             not the source, target status is `completed`,
#                                             source exists — so a refusal (exit 4) leaves
#                                             state.json byte-identical, as --claim and
#                                             --task-replay refuse.  One atomic apply then
#                                             sets the target to `pending`, bumps
#                                             metadata.fix_round ((fix_round // 0) + 1), stamps
#                                             metadata.gate_from_stage with the SOURCE's stage
#                                             code and metadata.gate_blockers to [<finding>],
#                                             and parks every consumer as `stale`.  Consumers
#                                             are transitive (downstream through blocked_by),
#                                             filtered to status == "completed", minus the
#                                             source and minus every REPLAY_SIDE_EFFECT_STAGES
#                                             code — the constant the cascading replay skips
#                                             by.  A consumer is PARKED, not reset: its
#                                             verdict, artifact and handoff survive, as the
#                                             target's own do.  Re-running the op is refused by
#                                             the `completed` guard itself, which is what makes
#                                             a retried route idempotent: no second bump.
# @arg --finding-file <path|->                The correction's finding, read from a file or
#                                             (with `-`) from STDIN — never from argv, so it
#                                             reaches neither the process table nor the audit
#                                             row's command head, and it is kept out of the

#                                             behind the return's evidence_ref, not in a
#                                             durable ledger field that renders into a prompt.

#                                             and counting it would return every dependent.
#                                             Both sides are normalised: a leading ./, a

# @exitcode 1   Internal error (jq merge failed; use --log to inspect), unsupported ledger
#               version, a ledger op rejected for an unknown/malformed task id, a frontmatter
#               staging failure (mktemp), no ledger resolved for --facts or a ledger op, an
#               unknown id on --claim/--dispatch/--files-read/--ack, an --ack row that failed
#               to append, or --facts with no ledger at --state (that write landed nothing
#               and says so).
# @exitcode 2   DISK_MIN_GB hard-halt (caller must remediate before retrying), OR a --facts
#               payload that was refused whole (bad JSON, unknown key, non-array value,
#               invalid branch) with state.json byte-unchanged, OR a --facts payload that
#               PARTIALLY succeeded: the valid items were persisted and the rejected ones are
#               named on stderr. Read stderr to tell them apart — a partial success is the
#               only exit 2 that wrote. Also: malformed --dispatch/--files-read/--ack args,
#               --dispatch without the row's metadata.agent, an unreachable lib or resolver,
#               or (--task-create) a row missing a required metadata key.  Also: a
#               --finding-file that is unreadable, empty, over 2000 bytes or carrying a
#               control byte, and a --task-reopen without --from.
# @exitcode 3   Artifact unresolved on the agent self-patch path (--prev given, --via absent),
#               OR a missing/unknown handoff.verdict on ANY path (--stage/--artifact,
#               plain or paired with --facts), state.json unchanged either way. An agent
#               patching the artifact it just wrote and finding nothing on disk, or finding a
#               verdict this map does not recognize, is a real failure; every other unresolved
#               case keeps the exit-0 no-op contract.
# @exitcode 4   Write refused by a pre-mutation guard, state.json untouched: a replay whose
#               target is live/parked, of indeterminate liveness, whose planning is
#               incomplete or whose cascade includes a blocked member; a stage code that
#               resolves to more than one open instance with nothing to disambiguate it; or
#               --claim on a settled (completed|skipped|failed) row or on a parked `stale` one;
#               or a --task-reopen whose target is the source or is not `completed`.
#               Unknown ids stay 1 and malformed ids stay 2.
# @exitcode 5   --verify-decision only: the row (or the chain it sits in) is refused — forged,
#               edited, out of scope, uncorroborated or answer-mismatched.  Every other op in
#               this file never returns 5.
#
# Note: --task-replay's liveness guard shells out to stale-check.sh, which needs python3.
# The dependency is out-of-process and fail-closed — without it the replay refuses (exit 4)
# rather than proceeding.  Every other op still needs only bash 3.2 + jq.
#
# Env vars honoured:
#   DISK_MIN_GB         (default 5)   — hard halt threshold in GiB
#   DISK_WARN_GB        (default 8)   — hygiene warn threshold in GiB
#   RUN_INDEX           — override run_index (for callers that know it without reading state.json)
#   CONTEXT_DIR         rank 2 of the root ladder (see state-read-lib.sh); the audit log
#                       and every derived path otherwise follow dirname(STATE_PATH)
#   STATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_S (default 5)  — max seconds to wait for the merge lock before
#                                       proceeding UNLOCKED + WARN (never a silent no-op)
#   STATE_LOCK_STALE_S  (default 60)  — a lock dir older than this (by mtime) is treated
#                                       as leaked and broken so a crashed writer cannot wedge merges
#
# Single-writer / idempotent-merge invariant: state.json is written only when the
# patch changes its content.  Temp file is PID+RANDOM-namespaced to guard against
# PID reuse in Task subagents (CR-7 from handoff-protocol.md#atomic-write).
#
# Minimum shell: bash 3.2+ (macOS default); relies on no bash 4+ features so the
# SubagentStop hook environment on older macOS is fully supported.

# Bare stage CODE → ledger key. Precedence: explicit --task-id, then the artifact match,
# then the status ladder the jq below spells (lowest N first — a split stage is worked in
# order). `completed` is never reused and `skipped` never resurrected: both were settled
# deliberately. Caller must have already established that $STATE_PATH exists.
#
# The artifact tier reads ARTIFACT_ARG — what the CALLER passed — never the stage-resolved
# $ART, which is a basename guess rather than a caller assertion and is not assigned until
# ~1100 lines below. Within it the RECORDED `.artifact` beats the PLANNED
# `.metadata.artifact`: PL0 seeds the planned name and a split stage routinely writes a
# different file (planned development-0-ledger.md, written development-1.md), so reading
# metadata first slots the patch by a stale guess — the mis-slotting this resolution exists
# to prevent. Metadata stays the fallback: it is the only artifact key a stage that has not
# completed yet carries.
#
# Ambiguity INSIDE the winning tier is fatal rather than arbitrary — two indistinguishable
# `in_progress` instances would land the patch on a coin flip. Ambiguity ACROSS tiers is not:
# the ladder orders those deliberately. Returns 1 before any lock is taken.

# The partition key is the FULL TASK ID (`DV1`), never the bare stage code: the writer is
# the task, and a four-way DV split is four independent writers who must not be able to
# evict one another. Questions carry that id in their own `sw-<TASK_ID>-<n>` id; decisions
# carry it in the `.stage` _FACTS_UNION_FILTER stamps from the writer's identity. An item
# with neither falls into the reserved "_" bucket, which keeps a pre-partition ledger in one
# shared bucket rather than scattering it across confident mis-attributions.
#
# `.stage` on a QUESTION keeps its bare-code meaning for the FN gate's grouping; that is a
# different job from partitioning, which is why the question's partition key is derived
# from the id (index retained) instead of read from `.stage`.
#
# Resolved-evicted-first is evaluated INSIDE each bucket. A global resolved-first pass with
# a per-bucket tail would let one task's resolved items protect another's — the cross-task
# coupling this partition exists to remove.
#
# Each clamp fires ONLY when some bucket exceeds its bound, and survivors keep their
# original positions, so a state inside the bounds is byte-identical to an unbounded merge
# (idempotency + no-op paths hold).
#
# The global ceiling is retired deliberately: worst-case size now scales with the task
# count. The backstop is validate_state's advisory token-budget warning plus the spill
# files — a loud oversized ledger beats a silently lost decision.

# `stage` and `status` are defaulted, never left null, on incumbents as well as incoming
# items: the FN gate groups unresolved items by stage and reads a missing status as
# unanswered, so a null in either renders an item nobody can attribute or act on. `stage`
# comes from the item's own id — `sw-<TASK_ID>-<n>` is the mandated shape, so the id IS the
# slot — falling back to the writing stage's code for a legacy id that predates it.
#
# open_questions unions through _union_sweep, not _union_keyed: last-writer-wins would let a
# re-emitted stub carrying `status: open` destroy an answer recorded against that id, and the
# element is the ONLY record of a sweep answer. `open < resolved` joins monotonically — a
# later write may raise, never downgrade — and the fields are guarded INDEPENDENTLY, because
# dropping the answer body is a downgrade too. `blocks_next_stage` is sticky only when the
# stub re-emits WITHOUT the key, so a rework round that drops it cannot demote a
# boundary-blocking item; an explicit `false` is the author speaking and CLEARS it. `has`,
# never truthiness, tells those apart — conflating them made `true` unclearable. Legacy
# payloads only: `--facts` requires the key. facts.decisions keeps _union_keyed.
#
# Object-merge (`. * $patch`) REPLACES arrays, so without this a downstream patch would drop
# every entry an upstream stage recorded. Identity is `.id`, or the string itself for the
# scalar arrays. Keyed survivors move to the TAIL because _STATE_BOUNDS_FILTER keeps the
# newest 8 of each task's bucket: appending is what makes "newest survives" true, where
# unique_by would hand the clamp an arbitrary 8. Scalars keep first-seen order — no clamp
# reads them.
#
# Decisions carry no id convention, so their partition key is stamped here: `.stage` is
# defaulted from the WRITER's own task id on the INCOMING array only, before concatenation.
# Defaulting the union would re-stamp every incumbent with the current writer and
# re-attribute PL's `pd1` to whoever writes next; incumbents without a stage stay in the
# reserved "_" bucket. An explicit `.stage` from the author always wins.

# never committed — a duplicate the union collapses — but never an eviction whose spill line

# artifact to the two fields this merge also writes: the mirrored facts.verdicts
# entry and, on a pending row, the gate_from_stage marker — either drifting from what this
# call would write means the merge is not actually a no-op.

# ---------- Build filter + atomic write ----------
# An atomic_apply filter, not a patch object precomputed outside the lock: the gate_from_stage
# set/delete and the derived worst-verdict key both read tasks.* as it stands INSIDE the
# lock, so they must run in the same critical section as the row write, not against a
# pre-lock snapshot a sibling writer could invalidate.
#
# Additive keys (completed_via, worktree) fold in only when present, so absence stays
# absence.  facts.verdicts[<TASK_ID>] is mirrored here because this is the only writer a
# patched stage passes through: the schema has carried the field since v2 and nothing ever
# filled it, so every consumer reading it saw an empty object.  facts.verdicts[<CODE>] is
# the worst verdict across every "${CODE}<N>" row that has reported, so a split
# stage's readers see the harder state rather than whichever instance completed last.
# --prev additionally emits handoffs["<PREV>→<TASK_ID>"] (maxLength 300, must contain
# "ref:"); absent --prev ⇒ no handoffs key at all.  The destination is the WRITING TASK, so
# an N-way split writes N edges instead of collapsing to one last-writer-wins entry; the
# source stays a bare code because it answers which stage this followed, and only the
# destination ever collided.
#
# tasks.<ID>.tests_executed mirrors the artifact's current list. rework_runs[] is
# append-only: a row carrying rework_pending (set by --task-replay) files its prior list as
# {round: last round + 1, tests_executed} before the mirror is overwritten, and the marker is
# consumed. Without a marker nothing is appended, so re-merging the same artifact never adds
# a round and earlier rounds are re-emitted untouched. An unparsed list skips the whole block
# and keeps the marker for a merge that can read it.
