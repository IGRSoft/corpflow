# @description preflight-issue-scan.sh — ADVISORY scan for open GitHub issues that
#   plausibly already cover the request, run at `/worktask` entry BEFORE `.context/`
#   is created (`commands/worktask.md § Step 2a`).
#
#   `skills/gh-issue-dedup` binds one issue per `.context/` via the anchor or an
#   exact-title search — both only reachable once a `.context/` exists, so they
#   guard re-runs and never the first run of work already filed under different
#   wording. This scan is the layer above: advisory only, human-confirmed, and it
#   NEVER links, comments, or writes. The exact-match-only auto-bind stays as is;
#   widening it would let an unrelated same-worded issue capture a fresh context.
#
#   Scoring is local keyword overlap rather than a server-side query because
#   GitHub's issue search ANDs free-text terms — a query built from a whole request
#   sentence returns nothing for exactly the paraphrase this must catch.
#
#   NON-BLOCKING BY CONTRACT, like every helper the orchestrator invokes with a
#   trailing `|| true`: no network, no `gh`, no auth, no remote, a timeout, a
#   malformed response, or zero hits all exit 0 with a `result=` the caller reads as
#   "proceed". There is no runtime state in which this step stops a worktask.
#
#   It writes NO audit row: the ledger it would append to does not exist yet at
#   Step 2a, and creating `.context/logs/` here would strand scratch state in a
#   worktask the user then abandons in favour of an existing issue.
#
# @arg --goal <text>      The user's request text. Empty => `skipped/no_goal`.
# @arg --context <dir>    .context dir probed for the dedup anchor (default: .context).
# @arg --limit <n>        Max candidates emitted (default: 3).
# @arg --no-gh-issue      Caller passed /worktask --no-gh-issue => `skipped/opted_out`.
# @arg -h | --help        Show this header.
#
# @env PREFLIGHT_ISSUE_SCAN   0 => `skipped/opted_out`.
# @env CORPFLOW_NONINTERACTIVE 1 => `skipped/non_interactive` (nothing can answer the gate).
# @env MILESTONE_MODE         1 => `skipped/milestone_mode` (/megatask owns issue identity).
# @env INCIDENT_MODE          1 => `skipped/incident_mode` (no PL stage, no plan issue).
# @env PREFLIGHT_SCAN_POOL    Issues fetched PER STATE before scoring (default: 100).
# @env PREFLIGHT_SCAN_TIMEOUT Seconds bounding each `gh` call (default: 20).
# @env GH_BIN                 `gh` binary (default: gh).
# @env WORKSPACE_ROOT         Root probed for a megatask `workspace.json`.
#
# @stdout `result=shown|prior-run|none|skipped`, `reason=<closed set>` when not `shown`,
#         `candidates=<n>` (OPEN hits only), and one `candidate=<compact-json>` line per
#         open hit (`{number,url,title,state,score}`). JSON per line because issue titles
#         contain every plausible field separator.
#
#         Every candidate and prior `title`/`url` has passed through
#         skills/shared/scripts/path-scrub.sh. When that scrub is missing or fails, no
#         candidate or prior line is printed and the result is `skipped/scrub_unavailable`.
#
#         CLOSED hits are reported separately as `priors=<n>` plus one `prior=<json>` line
#         each, and never as `candidate=`: a closed issue is a "this task ran before"
#         signal, not something to comment on or bind a fresh context to. `result=prior-run`
#         means closed matches only — callers keying on `result=shown` proceed unprompted,
#         which is the correct disposition.
#
# @exitcode 0   Every runtime outcome, candidates or not.
# @exitcode 2   Usage error or -h.
#
# Minimum shell: bash 3.2+ (macOS default).
