#   rename entry point) and fn-preflight.sh (surviving FN validator commands).
#
#   Dependency-free by construction: sources nothing, sets no shell options, does no
#   jq/git probing at load time, and has no side effects at load beyond idempotent
#   variable init. Its only failure mode is absence, which callers detect and report
#   loudly — see each caller's own guard.

#   target_branch_name, meta_json, audit_fn, fn_batch_scope, fork_base, _fork_base_uncached,
#   _base_ref_ranked, resolve_base_ref, base_ref_source, BRANCH_AUDIT_ACTORS, branch_audit_actor.
#
# Minimum shell: bash 3.2+ (macOS default).

# is rc 1 and kills a `set -e` caller (this file's own bats source it twice), and a
# space-delimited list yields one token under a caller's `IFS=$'\n\t'`. Accept list
# (13) is deliberately wider than what derive_type ever emits (11): `feat` and `style`
# are accepted so an existing short-form/style branch is never churned, but neither is
# ever generated. `fix` is intentionally absent — removed cleanly, not kept as a
# compatibility token — so a pre-existing `fix/<slug>` branch reads as non-conventional
# and gets renamed onto the derived `bugfix/`/`hotfix/` target. Canonical prose:

#   2. state.json .metadata.base_ref         stamped by PL0, mirrors task metadata.
#                                            This rank is where a host-declared
#                                            target branch enters the order — it is
#                                            that value's provenance, not a probe
#   3. workspace.json .git.base_branch       /megatask per-issue record
#   4. git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
#   -  unresolved                            reported, never guessed
# There is deliberately NO hardcoded literal. Callers degrade non-blocking.
#
# Rank 0 reconciles, it never overrides: when the fork point disagrees with the
# value a lower rank supplied, the disagreement is surfaced by the caller (PL0's
# sweep item, base-sanity's candidate line) and stdout is unchanged. An overriding
# rank 0 would defeat base-sanity, which compares the diff against the base the PR
# will actually target — the resolver would hand it the right base and every
# wrong-base PR would pass.
#
# It is opt-in for the same reason it never overrides. Every other consumer reads an
# EMPTY return as "decline, do not guess" and gates on it (refine-branch-target's
# base_unresolved no-op, branch-name, continuity, issue-close-required). Filling that
# empty with an inferred branch would make those gates act on a guess — the failure
# base-sanity spends a whole degrade rung (base_guessed) avoiding. Only a caller that
# can tell an inferred base from a configured one passes --with-fork-point.

# Fork-point evidence: the remote branch HEAD most closely descends from, by
# smallest ahead-count. $1 (optional) is the configured base, used for tie-break
# level 2 only; passing it as an argument is what keeps rank 0 from recursing back
# through resolve_base_ref. Always exits 0 — this library is sourced into
# `set -euo pipefail` scripts where a non-zero `v=$(fork_base)` kills the caller.
#
# Memoised per process and per argument. base-sanity reaches the ladder three times in one
# run — resolve_base_ref, base_ref_source, then the fork candidate — and each evaluation
# costs 2 x `git rev-list --count` per remote branch, so a 400-branch remote paid ~2400
# rev-lists on the blocking FN path. Refs cannot move mid-run, so the later calls reuse the
# first. The cache is process-local: a new shell, and every bats case is one, recomputes.
