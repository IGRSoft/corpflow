#!/usr/bin/env bash
# publish-pl-issue.sh — auto-publish a sanitised GitHub issue after PL approval.
#
# Invoked by the orchestrator after PL0 (skills/worktask/SKILL.md § PL Issue Publish). NEVER blocks the
# worktask: operational outcomes are audit.jsonl rows (result + reason) and exit 0; only a
# catastrophe (jq missing, audit dir unwritable, state corrupt) exits 1, and --self-test
# failure exits 2. An unreachable sibling folds into those two: publish-pl-issue-lib.sh
# missing is catastrophic, publish-pl-issue-selftest.sh missing is a self-test that cannot
# run. The lib is sourced eagerly (PUBLISH_LIB_ONLY consumers need it); the harness only on
# the --self-test arm, so the publish path never loads test code.
#
# Contracts owned elsewhere, implemented here — read the owner before changing behaviour:
#   - Cross-run dedup, the .context/gh-issue.json anchor, the marker-deduped follow-up
#     comment and milestone-mode: skills/gh-issue-dedup. Env: GH_ISSUE_ANCHOR (anchor path),
#     GH_ISSUE_SEARCH=0 (disable the title search).
#   - plan_file shape boundary (path in state.json, bare basename in task metadata; readers
#     MUST accept either): handoff-protocol.md § plan_file shape boundary. The PLAN_FILE block below
#     tries the value as given, then its basename against the state directory, and names both
#     candidates on the fatal path.
#   - {{asset:<basename>}} placeholder grammar and the .context/designs/-only lookup:
#     pl0-procedure.md § Asset-placeholder grammar. Tokens carry no path, so they survive
#     sanitiser Pass-1 L1; resolve_design_assets() rewrites them to hosted image lines AFTER
#     sanitisation, so no local path ever reaches the issue body.
#
# Sanitiser: two passes (awk line-strip L1-L9, then token-strip with allow-list A1-A5). A
# strip ratio over 50% aborts the publish and persists the body to
# .context/logs/issue-body-<run_index>.aborted.tmp rather than posting a gutted issue.
#
# Asset hosting — tier order, highest first. Each downgrade appends a non-blocking audit row
# under a distinct dedupe-key suffix (:asset_hosting) so it cannot mask the result row, and
# no tier ever emits a broken `![]()`:
#   0. user-attachments — the only tier that satisfies private-repo rendering, binary
#      payloads and no repo commit at once. Needs the `drogers0/gh-image` gh extension for
#      the browser session token; a PAT cannot drive the upload-policy flow (it is
#      web-session-oriented and rejects a Bearer token). Probed with `gh image check-token`.
#   1. raw.githubusercontent.com — REFUSED for a PRIVATE/INTERNAL repo and verified with an
#      anonymous `curl -fsIL` otherwise, because GitHub's camo proxy fetches ANONYMOUSLY: an
#      authenticated `gh api contents` check passes on a URL that renders broken.
#   2. gist — a public-or-secret gist raw URL is anonymously fetchable, so camo renders it
#      even inside a private repo. Render-verified by anonymous HEAD before it is emitted.
#   3. none — Figma URL plus one note line; bullets, never an embed.
#
#   Privacy: NEITHER gist kind preserves confidentiality — both are anonymously readable by
#   URL, which is exactly what makes them render. They differ in DISCOVERABILITY only, so the
#   default is auto (PRIVATE/INTERNAL → secret, PUBLIC/unknown → public). Material that must
#   not leave the org needs ASSET_HOST_MODE=none, not an unlisted URL.
#
#   raw path: the PNG is copied to .worktask-assets/<worktask_id>/<basename> on the worktask
#   branch. The helper does NOT commit or push — no surprising git side effects at Step 6.5 —
#   so it verifies the ref is reachable with `git ls-remote --exit-code origin <ref>` first
#   and degrades when it is not.
