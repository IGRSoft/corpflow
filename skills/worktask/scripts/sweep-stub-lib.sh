# @description sweep-stub-lib.sh — the SweepStub predicate, shared verbatim by the two
#   enforcers of `handoff.open_questions[]`: handoff-harness.sh (the frontmatter shape gate)
#   and state-patch.sh (the --facts ledger writer).
#
#   One definition, two enforcers: a stub that passes one and fails the other is the class of
#   disagreement this file exists to make impossible. Values are deduplicated here; the
#   semantics are pinned by the parity table in architecture-0.md#test-architecture.
#
#   Sources nothing, sets no options, does no work at load. Consumers interpolate the
#   constants into a yq expression or pass them to jq as --arg/--argjson — never splice a
#   regex into a jq program body, which would make the program caller-controlled.
#
#   Symbols: SWEEP_ID_RE, SWEEP_CLASS_ENUM, SWEEP_REF_RE.
#
# Minimum shell: bash 3.2+ (macOS default).

# The constants are read by the sourcing enforcers, never inside this file.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034

# Anti-execution guard — MUST be the first statement.
