<!--
TEMPLATE. Copy to the root of a USER PROJECT as CORPFLOW.md to override corpflow's
default plugin routing. corpflow reads exactly one heading from this file — `## Routing`
— everything else is yours (or delete everything else). Not to be confused with the
plugin-side CORPFLOW.md stage contract (templates/CORPFLOW.md), which sits at a sibling
plugin's root and must NOT contain a `## Routing` heading.

How overrides apply: rows here win over skills/shared/routing-matrix.md § Matrix, alias
by alias, resolved ONCE at worktask init into `state.routing` — edits mid-worktask take
effect on the next worktask. Overriding an entry alias does not implicitly override that
platform's role aliases; swapping a platform's plugin normally means overriding all five
(entry + architect + security-auditor + test-generator + code-fixer). A target that is
not installed falls back per routing-matrix.md § Resolution step 5 with a
`plugin_unavailable` audit row.

# corpflow Project Configuration

## Routing

Keep only the rows you override; delete the rest. Targets are fully-qualified
`plugin:agent` ids. The full alias list and every default target live in corpflow
`skills/shared/routing-matrix.md § Matrix` — deliberately not copied here, so this file
never drifts from the matrix. Aliases follow `corpflow:<plugin-role>` for entry points
(`corpflow:apple-developer`, `corpflow:ai-engineer`, …) and `corpflow:<platform>-<role>`
for functional roles (`corpflow:web-code-fixer`, `corpflow:systems-security-auditor`, …).

| Alias | Target |
|-------|--------|
| `corpflow:apple-developer` | `my-org-apple:apple-developer` |
| `corpflow:apple-code-fixer` | `my-org-apple:code-fixer` |

### Contract

An override target must satisfy the plugin contract
(`corpflow skills/cross-plugin-handoff/references/plugin-contract.md § A`): entry router,
functional-role agents, handoff frontmatter schema, and — ideally — its own root
CORPFLOW.md stage contract.

## Models

Keep only the rows you override; delete the rest. Same lifecycle as `## Routing`: rows here win
over the built-in default matrix (`corpflow skills/shared/stage-codes.md § Agent Model Matrix`),
row by row, resolved ONCE at worktask init into `state.models` — edits mid-worktask take effect
on the next worktask. This heading belongs to the **project-root** kind of this file only; the
plugin-root CORPFLOW.md stage contract (`templates/CORPFLOW.md`) must NOT carry it.

| Agent | Model | Effort |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `qa-engineer` | `opus` | `-` |

An empty or `-` cell inherits that agent's built-in value for the other column alone — a row
overriding only `Effort` leaves `Model` at the default. Agent is the bare corpflow basename (no
`plugin:` prefix, backticks optional).

### Validation is fail-open, row by row

A config typo must never brick a pipeline, and never silently lower a tier:

| Condition | Behaviour | Audit action |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Valid row | overrides that agent | `model_override` |
| Empty or `-` cell | that cell inherits the built-in value | `model_override` |
| Agent not in the matrix | row ignored, warning names the agent | `model_override_unknown` |
| Invalid model or effort value | row ignored, warning names the cell | `model_override_unknown` |
| Heading present, header garbled, or no rows | whole section ignored, `state.models_source` stays `"matrix"` | `model_override_unparsed` |
| An agent the matrix has no built-in row for and this section does not override either | dispatch falls back to the session model, warning names the agent | `model_unresolved` |

No `CORPFLOW.md`, or no `## Models` heading → all-default, no rows, no warning.
